It is also one of the most affordable universities in Nigeria, comparable to schools like KWASU. The institution of learning operates a high standard that other universities are learning from. LASU is one of the Nigerian institutions which have greatly utilized information and communication technology (ICT) in recording its students’ data online. Online student portals make the process of learning and the administration of the institution easier and faster. Generally, the LASU student portal is one of those platforms that has made things easier for the university and students.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lasu-student-portal></span><strong>LASU Student Portal</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The LASU student portal is a platform that contains all the details about every student of the university. In the school, the LASU Integrated Data Center (LIDC) is responsible for the collation and recording of each student’s profile details. All data concerning the students, ranging from admission to graduation, is contained in the portal. Only students who have successfully registered their profile details on the portal will have a record there. Once a student graduates, the person’s data will not be accessible anymore.</p><p>This means the LASU student portal can be accessed by LASU students only. Prospective students, first-year and continuing students are the ones who have access to the student portal. Because the information contained therein is confidential, each student’s details are used to log into his or her profile.</p><p>More so, the portal is for undergraduates, post-graduates, pre-degree students, and sandwich students. All students have a profile on the student portal. Contained in this article is a guide on what to do on the portal, and how to access the LASU student portal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=things-you-can-do-on-the-lasu-student-portal></span><strong>Things You Can Do on the LASU Student Portal</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>With the student portal, students are guided and cannot easily fall prey to fraudsters.
