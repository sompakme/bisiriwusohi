Jerry Seinfeld's notoriety has led to fans learning a lot about him. For example, fans learned that <a href=#>Rosie O'Donnell once stole his material</a> and there was <a href=#>a rumor he sued The Lego Movie</a>.</p><p>Even though a lot has been revealed about Jerry Seinfeld, there are some facts about the writer, comedian, and actor that most people don't know. One perfect example of that is the fact that most of Seinfeld's fans don't know who Jerry Seinfeld's daughter Sascha Seinfeld has become.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>what Sascha Seinfeld is doing professionally</strong> now that she is in her 20s.

At least, that will be the case unless something very dramatic happens in Jerry Seinfeld's life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Seinfeld is such a big part of her father's legacy and it made him rich, it makes sense that Sascha Seinfeld would see the value in working in TV. Fortunately for Sascha Seinfeld, she has the talent to work as a television writer.</p><p>In October 2022, a People report revealed that Jessica Seinfeld had used Instagram to celebrate her daughter, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sascha Seinfeld, getting her first TV writing job</a></strong>. "Congratulations @amyschumer on a new season of Inside Amy Schumer!

In reality, however, the odds against writing anything that airs on television are so high that anyone who achieves only that should be proud.</p><p>Who are Jerry Seinfeld's children, according to People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Child:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Birthday:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Sascha Seinfeld</p></td><td><p>November 7th, 2000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Julian Seinfeld</p></td><td><p>March 1st, 2003</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shepherd Seinfeld</p></td><td><p>August 22, 2005</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>On top of that, Sascha Seinfeld's TV writing career is more extensive than that.</p><p>On the website Metacritic, Sascha Seinfeld is listed as <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a staff writer on 10 episodes of the 2024 Hulu show Life & Beth</a></strong>.

Given Sascha Seinfeld's history with Schumer, it seems very likely that she played a role in her getting to work on Life & Beth.</p><p>The first reason that seems likely is that Sascha Seinfeld's first TV gig was writing a sketch for Inside Amy Schumer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/amy-schumer-at-the-premiere-of-only-murders-in-the-building-season-2.jpg><p>More notably, in November 2022, Amy Schumer spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about Sascha Seinfeld. While discussing the sketch Sascha Seinfeld wrote, <strong>Schumer stated that she trusted Jerry Seinfeld's daughter</strong> long before they began officially working together.</p><p>“For years, I’ve asked Sascha [Seinfeld] her opinion on things. I’m 41, I don’t have Snapchat. I just feel completely at a loss.

After all, some of the world's richest people set things up so their children get a lot of money once they reach a certain age.</p><p>Since Sascha Seinfeld isn't famous like her father, websites like Forbes and Celebrity Net Worth don't report on her. However, that doesn't mean that it is impossible to know anything about how wealthy Sascha Seinfeld is as of May 2024.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/erry-seinfeld-had-a-passionate-secret-affair-with-a-co-star-on-seinfeld-long-before-he-settled-down-with-his-wife-jessica.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Jerry Seinfeld Had A Passionate Secret Affair With A Co-Star On Seinfeld Long Before He Settled Down With His Wife, Jessica">Jerry Seinfeld Had A Passionate Secret Affair With A Co-Star On Seinfeld Long Before He Settled Down With His Wife, Jessica</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>When Jerry Seinfeld was starring in Seinfeld, he got involved with a famous star who appeared in an episode of the show.</p><p>Ever since Jerry Seinfeld became famous, he has used his comedy and interviews to tell the world what he thinks about various subjects.

During the resulting conversation, Jerry Seinfeld and Hart spoke about how they handled things when their kids asked if they were rich.</p><p><strong>These celebrities aren't leaving their money to their kids, according to Buzzfeed.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis</strong></li><li><strong>Jackie Chan</strong></li><li><strong>Bill Gates</strong></li><li><strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong></li><li><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></li><li><strong>Marie Osmond</strong></li><li><strong>Daniel Craig</strong></li><li><strong>Sir Elton John</strong></li><li><strong>Sting</strong></li><li><strong>George Lucas</strong></li><li><strong>Kevin O'Leary</strong></li><li><strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong></li><li><strong>Laurene Powell Jobs</strong></li><li><strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong></li><li><strong>Mackenzie Scott</strong></li><li><strong>Andrew Lloyd Webber</strong></li><li><strong>Bernard Marcus</strong></li></ul><p>While talking to Hart, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Seinfeld told him that when his kids asked if they were rich</a></strong>, he responded, "I am, you're not."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jerry-seinfeld-jessica-seinfeld-sascha-seinfeld-julian-seinfeld-and-shepherd-seinfeld-at-a-premiere-for-unfrosted.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While that line is funny, Jerry Seinfeld's brand of comedy typically reveals his perspective on the world. As a result, it makes sense to assume that Jerry Seinfeld was telling the truth that he is rich and his kids aren't.</p><p>Based on that comment, <strong>Sascha Seinfeld likely isn't worth millions like her parents</strong>.</p><p>That said, it seems clear that Sascha Seinfeld has had some big financial advantages. For example, Sascha Seinfeld has a degree from Duke University and she almost certainly didn't have to go into debt to get it like many people do. Sascha Seinfeld's social media activity also shows that she lives very comfortably thanks to her parents' fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqirnq0scinnZ6klKh6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiwKK%2FwqGYZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
