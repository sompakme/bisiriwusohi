All outward appearances pointed to the same. Both were successful and had fortunes they had amassed, <a href=#>with Shakira being worth slightly more</a>, and two healthy boys. But, looks can be deceiving. And after Shakira and Piqué spent over a decade and had two children together, the two called it quits in an <a href=#>eerily similar to another breakup the singer had years before</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the aftermath of the breakup, there were rumors about the <a href=#>truth of their relationship</a> and what caused a rift, but there was nothing concrete. That is until Shakira started releasing <a href=#>songs with cryptic messages</a>. The first of which was the song, Monotonía, a song that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave fans a bit more insight as to why she and Piqué went their separate ways</a>.</p><p>The biggest revelation came when Shakira released BZRP Music Session #53, however. This is because not only did the Waka Waka singer allegedly name both Piqué and the woman he had an affair with, Clara Chia Marti in the song by name, but the lyrics speak directly to Piqué leaving Shakira for a younger woman.</p><p>Worse still, the song talks about Shakira being left to live on the same property as her then-partner's parents. The same in-laws who condoned the affair, when Shakira thought <a href=#>her mother-in-law was supporting her</a>. Because of this, rumors began to spread that the Beautiful Liar singer sold the house out from under her in-laws.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-shakira-sell-the-property-her-in-laws-live-in>Did Shakira Sell The Property Her In-Laws Live In?</h2><p>The property that Shakira and Piqué lived on was purchased by the couple in 2012. When it was purchased, they upgraded it so that the homes on the adjoining properties were all connected. This includes both Sharkia's parents' and Piqué's. Despite not being married, it was clear that Shakira and Gerard considered their families blended.</p><p>When Piqué and the Hips Don't Lie singer called it quits, they had to figure out what they were going to do with their property. Eventually, they decided to sell it. And it was when the house went on the market that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors began that Shakira was selling the property out from underneath her pseudo-in-laws</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/shakira-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The house Pique’s mother was living In is the house Shakira kindly bought for her. Shakira sold it after all this," one Reddit user stated.</p><p>Another user asked, "Didn’t Shakira buy her that house? This just gets worse and worse. Throw the whole Pique family away. Basura!"</p><p>"I don’t blame her," a third Reddit user said. "I wouldn’t have even given her an eviction notice. I would’ve literally thrown her out with the clothes on her back and never allow her back in."</p><p>With all the tongue-wagging about Shakira throwing her mother-in-law out, it actually appears that this is not the case. In fact, after an agreement was made in court, Shakira agreed to sell her portion of the house to Piqué, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as documented in a transfer document</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"According to the Land Registry, the house, which previously belonged to Shakira and Gerard Piqué, became the property of Inversiones BCN Two & Two SL in September 2022." This trust is owned by Piqué and his father.</p><p>As such, it was Shakira who was living in a home that was no longer hers for several months. And, it appears she may have been paying rent to do so.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Gerard Pique's Infidelity Actually Helped Shakira's Career</a></span></p><p>"The letter indicated that if Shakira, her children, and parents, remained in the property... after the stated date, she would have to pay compensation," according to News Break.</p><p>Therefore, Shakira did not sell the property her in-laws live on in Spain. But, that did not stop her from putting up a wall to not have to interact with them.</p><h2 id=why-shakira-built-a-wall-on-her-property>Why Shakira Built A Wall On Her Property</h2><p>Even though the property was no longer in Shakira's name in January 2023, that did not stop the She Wolf singer from making sure that she did not have any contact with her in-laws. And in order to accomplish this, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she began construction on a wall between the two properties</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakira-1.jpg><p>Shakira and Piqué essentially turned their property and his parent's property into a compound. This meant partially connecting the two properties to gain access to either at any time of the day. This is something that Shakira seemingly wanted to remedy when she was left in the home with her two children after Piqué moved back to his apartment.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Often Does Sasha Pique Mebarak See His Father?

This ensured that any interaction would be minimal, if at all, given Shakira's anger at her mother-in-law in particular for allowing the affair to happen between Piqué and Marti.</p><h2 id=shakira-is-leaving-spain-for-a-new-life-in-miami>Shakira Is Leaving Spain For A New Life In Miami</h2><p>Shakira had plans to leave Spain with her boys, Milan and Sasha, as soon as the custody agreement was ratified by the court, wherein <a href=#>Piqué gave up custody of the boys</a>. However, she was delayed in the country for several months. That is, until April 2023, when the Deja Vu singer, finally packed her bags as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and her sons were off to Miami to rebuild their lives after the affair</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shakira.jpg><p>"I settled in Barcelona to give my children a stability, the same we are now looking for in another corner of the world next to family, friends and the sea," Shakira, explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Today we start a new chapter in the pursuit of their happiness.
