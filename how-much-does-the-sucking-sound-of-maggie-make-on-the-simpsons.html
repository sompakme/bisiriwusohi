Rightfully so, it comes from a voice-actor who sounds several different starts on the show, including her most notable, Bart Simpson.</p><h2 id=nancy-cartwright-plays-bart-maggie-and-5-other-characters-on-39-the-simpsons-39>Nancy Cartwright Plays Bart, Maggie And 5 Other Characters On 'The Simpsons'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's right, the person in charge of Maggie's sucking noise is none other than 'The Simpsons' legend, Nancy Cartwright. Along with Maggie, Nancy has a slew of responsibilities on the show, which includes voicing other characters such as Bart, Nelson, and Ralph as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Did 'The Simpsons' Predict Yet Another Technological Marvel Before Its Time?</a></span></p><p>Although she's a well-known name these days, Nacy admitted alongside Awards Daily that this wasn't always the case. According to 'The Simpsons' star, <a href=#>it took three years to finally get noticed.</a></p><p>“I’ve been submitting myself over the years, and it took 31 years until I finally got nominated! When I found out I got that nomination a couple of years ago, I went to a couple of parties, and people asked me, ‘What are you nominated for?’ ‘Oh, I’m the voice of Bart Simpson.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, she revealed that fans are always shocked to find out that she also plays other characters on the show, including voicing Maggie.</p><p>"Nobody knew that, and I think that had something to do with it. I feel like it might have been considered that I have a body of characters, an arsenal of characters in my treasure trove.”</p><p>Since her time on the show, not only has Cartwright's responsibilities grown but she also saw a huge increase in pay.</p><h2 id=nancy-cartwright-makes-300-000---400-00-per-episode>Nancy Cartwright Makes $300,000 - $400,00 Per Episode</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her role on the show has changed throughout the years. Nancy now has an important role behind the scenes as well, in terms of both writing and producing.</p><p>Given all her tasks, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise to learn that the star is making an estimated $300,000 to $400,000 per episode.</p><p>This leaves Cartwright with quite the net worth of $80 million, a number that is only set to increase given that the animated series doesn't appear to be ending anytime soon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The Truth About "Stupid Sexy Flanders" Gag On 'The Simpsons'</a></span></p><p>The voice of Bart would admit alongside Variety that <a href=#>working behind the scenes was a completely different animal.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I have so much more understanding of the whole process. It’s only when you can go in there and roll up your sleeves and sit down with the guys where this is their job…it gave me a better conceptual understanding of how much a collaborative process writing for television is. It was extraordinary. I cherish this experience; I thought it was amazing. And I’m changed forever now, because of that."</p><p>Despite the tremendous pay and net worth, Nancy doesn't have the highest bank account amongst her peers.</p><h2 id=hank-azaria-and-dan-castellaneta-are-the-richest-cast-members>Hank Azaria And Dan Castellaneta Are The Richest Cast Members</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An $80 million net worth is certainly nothing to scoff at. However, there are 'Simpsons' stars with higher net worths, including Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer, Krusty, and various others. The actor has a net worth of $85 million, while Hank Azaria also barely edges him out, with a huge net worth of $90 million. The veteran has voiced countless characters in the past, including Moe, Lou, Professor Frink, and others. He also played on other shows such as 'Friends' and the film 'Godzilla'.</p><p>Believe it or not, <a href=#>these voice-over stars don't come close to the leaders.</a></p><p>Seth MacFarlane has a net worth of $300 million, while Money Inc indicates that South Park stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone are among the top by a mile, with Parker worth $600 million, while Matt Stone is in the vicinity of $700 million. Together, the two are in the territory of the billion-dollar mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Voice-over work can be insanely profitable but as we've seen with a lot of these figures, they're also doing lots of working behind the scenes, and in addition, they are able to work on other projects as well elsewhere.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Trey Parker Vs Matt Stone: Which 'South Park' Creator Has A Higher Net Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilmqaTrnqkrdGtrquhl53BbrnAoJ6inV2ptaZ50qKkqaufo8Buv8ClmKuxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
