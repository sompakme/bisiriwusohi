After all, Lopez has released a lot of hit <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong>, <a href=#>starred in several successful movies</a>, and she is married to <strong><a href=#>Ben Affleck</a></strong> years after it seemed like they weren't meant to be.</p><p>However, there also have been many stories about drama in Lopez's life, including the report that <a href=#>she has a no-female flight attendant rule for Affleck</a>. There also have been rumors that Lopez doesn't get along with Affleck's best friend <a href=#>who is a huge movie star, Matt Damon</a>. Based on that reporting fans want to know what the truth is about Lopez and Damon's relationship.</p><p>This article will reveal why many <strong>fans think that Jennifer Lopez and Matt Damon can't stand each other</strong>. Then, the article will look at why <strong>it seems like Lopez and Damon get along</strong> even if they aren't best friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-fans-think-that-matt-damon-and-jennifer-lopez-can-39-t-stand-each-other>Why Fans Think That Matt Damon And Jennifer Lopez Can't Stand Each Other</h2><p>Over the last few decades, there have been a handful of celebrity couples that the tabloids obsessed over. For whatever reason, there has always been something about Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck that the tabloids and gossip websites can't get enough of.</p><p>Since many members of the media report on every rumor about Lopez and Affleck, there often seems to be endless rumors about the couple. That effect has also enveloped some of the other people in the couple's life, including Affleck's best friend, Matt Damon.</p><p>One example of that is the fact that the website Marca published an article that stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon can't stand how Lopez treats Affleck</a>. Marca's 2023 article, which quoted an insider who spoke to the National Enquirer, <strong>claims that Damon and Lopez have been feuding</strong>.</p><p>"It's no secret that Ben <strong></strong>and JLo <strong></strong>don't get along, as he always seems to be in the doghouse. It's obvious something needs to change, but when Matt <strong></strong>started giving Ben <strong></strong>advice, everything exploded."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-felt-bad-for-ben-affleck-after-he-and-jennifer-lopez-s-history-of-fighting-in-public-was-exposed-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>Marca's article went on to make other claims about Lopez and Damon's relationship. According to the article, Damon believed that Lopez had made Affleck "become a brainwashed robot".</p><p>Furthermore, the article claimed that <strong>Damon could no longer stop himself from calling out Lopez</strong>.</p><p>"Matt <strong></strong>has had serious reservations about Bennifer 2.0 from the beginning. He's tried to publicly support Ben, but the fact is he hates the way JLo <strong></strong>treats his friend and can no longer bite his tongue."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/matt-damon.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matt Damon Thinks Team America World Police Made Him Look Good Despite Their Savage Celebrity Parody</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt Damon's brutal portrayal in Team America World Police was savage but he believes that he got the last laugh.</span><p>While Marca's article is interesting, it is far from groundbreaking. Instead, the truth is that there has been seemingly endless reporting that claims that Damon and Lopez don't get along at all. Some of the other reports about Damon and Lopez have claimed that another person has come between Affleck's wife and best friend.</p><p>What is the timeline of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck's relationship, according to People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Event:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Timeline:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>First Meeting</p></td><td><p>Early 2002</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Get Engaged</p></td><td><p>November 2002</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Postpone Wedding</p></td><td><p>September 10, 2003</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Break Up</p></td><td><p>January 2004</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dating Again</p></td><td><p>April 2021</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Get Engaged Again</p></td><td><p>April 2022</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Get Married</p></td><td><p>July 16, 2022</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/matt-damon-and-luciana-barroso-vanity-fair-oscars-party.jpg><p>According to a March 2024 report from The International News that cites an insider, <strong>Matt Damon's wife and Jennifer Lopez don't get along</strong> at all. The reason for that tension, according to the outlet, is that Lopez was jealous of the relationship that Damon's wife, Luciana Barroso, had with Affleck.</p><p>The outlet's report also claims that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wanted to go on vacation in Mexico with both of their lives. However, that hadn't happened because Barroso reportedly gets on Lopez's nerves.</p><p>Additionally, The International News' report claims that Damon and Affleck were getting sick of Lopez and Barroso feuding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-damon-and-jennifer-lopez-actually-seem-to-get-along-fine>Matt Damon And Jennifer Lopez Actually Seem To Get Along Fine</h2><p>From the outside looking in, there is no way to know if Jennifer Lopez and Matt Damon get along. That said, there is a lot of <strong>evidence that Lopez and Damon get along fine</strong> despite all the rumors about the two of them feuding.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_how-close-are-stepsiblings-fin-affleck-and-emme-maribel-muniz-_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Close Are Stepsiblings Fin Affleck And Emme Maribel Muñiz?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's teen children Emme Muñiz and Fin Affleck have a truly remarkable step-sibling relationship.</span><p>In April 2024, Damon showed his support for Lopez in a very noteworthy way. Damon did this by attending an event where Lopez was presented with the Premio Orgullo (Pride Award) by the Hispanic Federation.</p><p>As anyone familiar with Damon's career will already know, he is a very busy man. As a result, the fact that Damon took the time to be there to celebrate when Lopez received that award speaks volumes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar52892684-1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Damon attending Lopez's awards show, they have <strong>socialized at times seemingly without Affleck involved</strong>. Also in April 2024, the paparazzi captured photos of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Damon and Lopez going to a restaurant to enjoy lunch together</a>. If Affleck joined them for lunch, the paparazzi didn't capture photos of his arrival, which would be surprising.</p><p>According to People's article about Lopez and Damon's lunch, they met for a meal in New York City. The famed duo reportedly had their meal in a restaurant named Sadelle's in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood.</p><p>Damon also brought his wife, Luciana Barroso, to his lunch with Lopez. That fact seems to indicate that <strong>reports claiming Lopez and Barroso can't stand each other are inaccurate</strong> as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/matt-damon-is-one-of-many-actors-who-reportedly-turned-down-a-role-in-james-cameron-s-multi-billion-dollar-avatar-franchise.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matt Damon Is One Of Many Actors Who Reportedly Turned Down A Role In James Cameron's Multi-Billion Dollar Avatar Franchise</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matt Damon and some other stars turned down the chance to star in The Academy Award-worthy Avatar and Avatar: The Way Of Water.</span><p>It is also worth noting that Damon has publicly stated that he rooted for Affleck and Lopez in the past. Back when Lopez and Affleck's rekindled relationship was just a rumor, Damon was asked about the pair during a Today appearance. While Damon refused to confirm they were dating at the time, he expressed that he was rooting for Affleck and Lopez.</p><p>“It’s a fascinating story. I hope it’s true. I love them both. That would be awesome.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-1.jpg><p>At the end of the day, it certainly is possible that Matt Damon and Jennifer Lopez dislike each other. After all, Lopez and Damon could be putting up with each other for Affleck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Lopez and Damon have routinely been seen socializing, and they've never said anything negative about each other. With that in mind, it seems very likely that Damon and Lopez simply get along with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmK6osDTZpuapZ%2BjerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
