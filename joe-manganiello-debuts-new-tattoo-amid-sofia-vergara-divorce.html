The actor posed to display the text, which is written in Armenian with a calligraphy-style font. According to Malayan, the word is angel.</p><p>Over the years, Manganiello has been proud of his Armenian heritage and has spoken up about his great-grandmother, who survived the 1915 Armenian Genocide and later moved to America.</p><p>“I didn’t realize how underrepresented the Armenian story is out there, I didn’t realize how me telling my great-grandmother’s story, just simply she survived, therefore, I can be here today to tell her story and say her name and have a show like Dr. Gate’s show Finding your Roots, to have the ability to have me tell her story,” Manganiello said while speaking at an April <a href=#>Armenian Genocide commemorative event</a> in Los Angeles. “I didn’t realize how many of those stories haven’t been heard and how many people don’t know the story of the Armenians.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joe-manganiello-debuts-new-tattoo-amid-sofia-vergara-divorce-inline.jpg><p>Manganiello’s latest tattoo comes one month after news broke that he and Vergara, 51, <a href=#>called it quits</a> after 7 years of marriage.</p><p>“We have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the pair said in a <a href=#>joint statement</a> on July 17, days before Manganiello officially filed the paperwork. “As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.”</p><p>Days after announcing their split, Manganiello <a href=#>filed for divorce</a>. According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly at the time, the duo’s date of separation was listed as July 2. A source later told Us that Vergara and Manganiello were no longer “<a href=#>on the same page</a>” in their relationship.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She would rather go out with friends and he would rather stay home, so they wouldn’t spend a lot of time together,” the insider explained. “They’ve been living separate lives for about a year now, so it was time to call things off.”</p><p>Since Manganiello’s filing, Vergara <a href=#>filed her own set of legal documents</a> requesting for the court to enforce the twosome’s prenuptial agreement. In the docs, the actress noted that she wants certain assets to remain under her ownership and to maintain her earnings from before and during her relationship with Manganiello. Both Vergara and Manganiello are <a href=#>working on their divorce settlement</a>, including <a href=#>custody of their pooch</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5%2B8pnnMmqWgmZ6esq24zmabnpqlqcBuusSwZK2ZpKm8sHnApqCdZaOks6qtjK%2Bcq5%2BRp65usMivpqublWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
