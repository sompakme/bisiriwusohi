According to The New York Times, Harley Pasternak, the former employee, detailed visiting Ye’s home during the manic episode. 
Pasternak expressed that his visit arrived in the aftermath of West’s rant supporting Donald Trump in November 2016. It was around the same time that a paranoid West thought that JAY-Z was sending “killers” to silence him. When Pasternak arrived at Kanye’s home, he claims he found the artist writing on his bedsheets and packed his suitcases with a bevy of cooking ware."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most of the German employees in the meeting took offense to his actions, mainly because it is prohibited in Germany to use the symbol outside of artistic purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the controversial musician</a> had allegedly “advised” a Jewish <a href=# id=auto-tag_adidas data-tag=adidas>Adidas</a> employee “to kiss a<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> picture of Hitler every day</a>.” The visionary also reportedly forced Adidas executives to “watch pornography” for inspirational purposes.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Times&nbsp;found [that] Mr. West made Adidas executives watch pornography during a meeting at his Manhattan apartment, ostensibly to spark creativity,” the report reads. “In February 2015, preparing to show the first Yeezy collection at New York Fashion Week, staff members complained that he had upset them<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with angry, sexually crude comments.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-543615202.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cur8XEZq6eq6Rif3F9lWaknqaklrlurtGemKScn6y7bn2RbGtxaGZugnh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
