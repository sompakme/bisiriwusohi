While appearing on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Black Girl Stuff</a>,&nbsp;she talked about living with lupus.&nbsp;She expressed that life with lupus is “difficult,” especially in show business. However, for her career, she has to power through the pain.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Lupus is a stress-related disease</a>. It’s a silent, invisible struggle ’cause you can’t see it. You wake up in the morning and you look just fine, but you really feel like you got ran over by a train… There’s a lot of different things that<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> I’ve experienced with this diagnosis</a>, everything from hair loss to skin rashes. Being in this business is vainglorious, so that affects my output so much,” the “Hrs & Hrs” artist explained.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When I feel good, I look good, I produce well. When I feel like crap, and I gotta go out… Even something as small as someone touching my arm, it hurts.
