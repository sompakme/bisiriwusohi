But there's something about Hilaria that created its own scandal, though a far less tragic one than the Rust shooting. <a href=#>Hilaria Baldwin has been spotlighted for "faking" her Spanish heritage</a> in the past, and now, the truth has come out regarding her real name.</p><h2 id=hilaria-39-s-not-so-spanish-scandal>Hilaria's Not-So-Spanish Scandal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hilaria-baldwin-in-an-interview.jpg><p>Ever since she was linked to Alec Baldwin (they were married in 2012 after meeting in 2011), Hilaria has been known as Hilaria. But after Alec's bad behavior began to draw attention in the media, people began speaking out about Hilaria's background and alleging that she was appropriating Spanish culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though <a href=#>she eventually posted an "apology" to social media</a> for the apparent misunderstanding, Hilaria maintains that she is multicultural and culturally fluid, among other things.</p><p>Her alleged Spanish heritage also seemed to influence her children; their names are Carmen, Rafael, Leonardo, Romeo, Eduardo, Maria, and Ilaria. The Baldwins often refer to their brood as the Baldwinitos.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Slam Hilaria Baldwin For Using A Picture Of Her Kid For Cultural Appropriation">Fans Slam Hilaria Baldwin For Using A Picture Of Her Kid For Cultural Appropriation</a></span></p><p>Language wasn't the only thing in question in the whole Spanish scandal, though; people accused Hilaria of dyeing her hair to appear more Hispanic, and she was also said to have faked an accident (though inconsistently).</p><p>After all of this, it came out that Hilaria was not even her real name, which led fans to question her real, legal name and when she might have changed it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-hilaria-baldwin-39-s-legal-name>What Is Hilaria Baldwin's Legal Name?</h2><p>According to multiple sources, Hilaria Baldwin's legal name at birth was Hillary Lynn Hayward-Thomas. This is the name listed on her Wikipedia page, but there are few details about her name change, apart from becoming a Baldwin upon marrying Alec in 2012.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Done With Babies?

Hilaria Baldwin Doubts She Can Do Pregnancy Again After No. 7</a></span></p><p>Of course, ever since she grew to fame on Alec's arm, people have flocked to online forums to gossip about Hilaria, and the topic of her name has come up often. Some super-sleuthing fans found legal documents that establish a timeline of Hilaria's name change, but the information still doesn't answer all their questions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It did, however, bring up more questions and invite more speculation.</p><h2 id=when-did-hilary-baldwin-change-her-name-to-hilaria>When Did Hilary Baldwin Change Her Name To Hilaria?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hilaria-baldwin-in-yoga-studio.jpg><p>The interested parties who wondered about Hilaria's name change online eventually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recovered legal records through an online search</a>. The details they shared, which came from the New York State Unified Court System, confirm that Hillary Lynn Hayward-Thomas legally changed her name to Hilaria Hayward-Thomas in March 2010 (the paperwork was filed in February).</p><p>Details from the docket show that Hillary submitted her court petition without a lawyer and that the change was granted with no argument. Some speculated over the reason for the name change, which was not revealed on the paperwork.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One commenter suggested that changing her name went along with Hillary's new job at Yoga Vida; the yoga studio opened right around the time that Hillary submitted her name change (January 2010).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Why Fans Are Bothered About Alec And Hilaria Baldwin's Big Family">Why Fans Are Bothered About Alec And Hilaria Baldwin's Big Family</a></span></p><p>They speculated, "I def think it was part of the 'exotic foreign Yoga teacher' persona she was beginning to develop as a way of standing out in that competitive market."</p><p>The same commenter elaborated that apparently, Hillary's timeline to becoming Hilaria began when she was on a Latin Ballroom dancing team, which they assume was her introduction to the possibility of putting on a spray tan and becoming Latina.</p><p>This follows <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Hilaria's former dance partner alleges</a>; that Hilaria always had a "desire to be considered Spanish." Hilaria formerly claimed to have been Spanish, though she later admitted she changed her name (and that she was born in Boston).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet she says she's raising her children to be bilingual, "just as [she] was raised." She's even named her youngest child after herself—her chosen moniker, not her birth name.</p><h2 id=why-the-name-hilaria>Why The Name Hilaria?</h2><p>As for the reason why Hillary became Hilaria, of all things, commenters couldn't quite comprehend.</p><p>One person suggested, "Her parents did not start calling her Hilaria. I think when they first went to Spain and started meeting people they started calling her Hilaria. Either because it was easier or sounded better. I doubt the parents even knew there was a Spanish version of Hilary."</p><p>But another disagreed, saying, "I’m both Spaniard and Hispanic and really no one is named 'Hilaria'…"</p><p>Regardless, Hilaria stands behind her explanations of her heritage and childhood, and seems reluctant to back down from claims that she's actually Spanish even though, by all accounts, it doesn't appear that she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0eceio5qqmZZ6o63Lna6ipl2hsqity2almqWVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
