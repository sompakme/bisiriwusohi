We may be obsessed with skincare, but when it comes to oral hygiene, let’s be honest — our excitement level shoots way down. Of course we want healthy teeth, fresh breath and pretty-pink gums, but we just don’t have it in us to spend more than a few minutes max on oral care every morning and night!"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>We may be obsessed with skincare, but when it comes to oral hygiene, let’s be honest — our excitement level shoots way down. Of course we want healthy teeth, fresh breath and pretty-pink gums, but we just don’t have it in us to spend more than a few minutes max on oral care every morning and night!</p><p>If we’re looking to maintain a beaming grin with as little effort as possible, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PerioSciences AO ProVantage gel</a> is going to be our smile savior. It’s a water-based, aqueous gel that’s so easy and quick to apply, and so many skeptic shoppers were almost instantly transformed into believers after trying it just once!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/PerioSciences-Gel.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PerioSciences AO ProVantage</a> gel starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$37</a> at Dermstore!</strong></p><p>We’ll admit, even we were shocked to see just how positive the reviews of this gel were. Even one shopper, a dentist, said this is “one of the best products” they’ve found for helping their patients, especially those suffering from severe dry mouth. Others noted how it “heals mouth sores quickly” — one even said that this gel “healed [their] gum completely” overnight after a nasty cut! One reviewer also said how their gums “feel fortified” now that they’re using this gel. So many noticed an “immediate difference” in their oral health, and now we’re just dying to try it!</p><p>Shoppers also agree on the excellent flavor of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this gel</a>. It’s not as intense as toothpaste, but it doesn’t taste like medicine, either. It’s infused with wild mint, sage and clove oil, offering us a fresh and natural flavor for crisp and clean breath!</p><p>This gel is full of naturally-sourced antioxidants that may prevent free radical activity in our mouth. We fight off free radicals daily with our skincare, so why not within our mouth, too? We may recognize the phloretin and ferulic acid in this product from our favorite serums, but they’re excellent for oral care, as well. They are both super popular for reducing sensitivity in teeth and healing oral cells fast!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gel-Texture.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PerioSciences AO ProVantage</a> gel starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$37</a> at Dermstore!</strong></p><p>The idea of putting gel in our mouth might sound potentially nauseating to some of us, especially those of us who failed at our first attempt of oil pulling. We can ease our fear and our stomachs, however, because this gel isn’t sticky, gooey or thick. It’s watery and will glide right over our gums!</p><p>After brushing we should take a pea-sized amount of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this gel</a> and spread it across our gums using our fingertip, a cotton swab or a soft toothbrush. After it dissolves, we can spit out any excess and go on with our day or night!</p><p>All of PerioSciences’ products are science-backed, with heavy research and thorough testing involved in each and every formulation. It feels like there are a million toothpastes and mouthwashes to choose from at the drugstore, so the fact that this treatment stands out so high above the rest looks like an amazing sign to Us!</p><p>A healthy mouth is key to a stunning smile. If we can’t quite convince ourselves to floss twice a day, every day, we’re willing to forgive ourselves, but only if we keep up with using this gel! We might even want to smile more often once we see our new-and-improved teeth and gums!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PerioSciences AO ProVantage</a> gel starting at just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$37</a> at Dermstore!</strong></p><p><strong>Looking for something else?
