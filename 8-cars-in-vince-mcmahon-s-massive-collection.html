They occasionally share photos with those marvels and have the fanbase going bananas over how awesome those cars look. Yet, whenever it comes to automobiles, <a href=#>Vince McMahon's expensive collection</a> is unparalleled. Although money cannot buy taste, it is evident that McMahon either has outstanding tastes in vehicles or is consulting with someone who does.</p><p>With a <a href=#>net worth of billions</a>, McMahon has amassed a vast collection of automobiles over the years, including some of the flashiest models. Here is a list of the astounding automobiles he owns.</p><h2 id=2007-mercedes-benz-sl600>2007 Mercedes-Benz SL600</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To some, the Mercedes-Benz SL600 may resemble a fluffy cream puff due to its reputation for being both stylish and pleasurable to drive. Take into account that under that lengthy hood lies a twin-turbo V12 engine that provides an abundance of power and powerful acceleration. The only issue is why McMahon is holding on to this edition of the SL, given the enormous performance gains achieved with the current model? It may have emotional significance, but that is the closest one can speculate.</p><h2 id=1967-chevrolet-corvette>1967 Chevrolet Corvette</h2><p>Why not have a C2 Corvette if you can have virtually any automobile in the world? According to reports, McMahon is particularly fond of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1967 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray</a>, and people appreciate him for that. Even though he has other spectacular vehicles, this is America's sports car and a masterpiece that anyone would be happy to acquire. 1967 was the last year that the popular C2 Corvettes were produced, thus many people regard them with great nostalgia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 WWE Superstars Vince McMahon Held Back (And 5 Fans Only Think He Did)</a></span></p><h2 id=lincoln-town-car-limousine>Lincoln Town Car Limousine</h2><p>Being a busy individual, McMahon frequently needs transportation. If he wishes to come in elegance for a fight or any other occasion, he can drive his Lincoln Town Car limousine. With more subdued aesthetics than contemporary Cadillac limos, this form of transportation is refined. Moreover, if he so wished, he could invite a large number of friends along.</p><p>In a humorous aside, around nine years ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McMahon orchestrated his own death</a> in another Lincoln Town Car limousine. Then, approximately one and a half years ago, Braun Strowman pulled the door off McMahon's second Lincoln Town Car limousine and threw it over. The man has an evident obsession with Lincoln limos being trashed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lamborghini-aventador>Lamborghini Aventador</h2><p>When you have over a billion dollars in the bank, what automobile would you purchase? The option if your name is Vince McMahon is the Lamborghini Aventador. These retail for $417,000 or more, so you must be wealthy to even consider purchasing one. This is hardly a car for those who like to fly under the radar, as even pedestrians will notice it passing by. In addition to its famously angular Lambo design, the Aventador has a 0-60 time of 2.9 seconds thanks to a screaming V12 engine producing 729 horsepower.</p><h2 id=audi-r8>Audi R8</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The Audi R8 was immortalized by Tony Stark in the Avengers films</a>, making it the ideal toy for a billionaire. The technologically advanced automobile is equipped with a number of electronic aids to prevent drivers from getting into too much difficulty when applying the accelerator. In fact, the mid-mounted V10 propels this supercar from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Times Vince McMahon Was Not Boss Of The Year (And 10 Times He Was Better Than We Thought)</a></span></p><h2 id=bentley-continental-gt-supersport>Bentley Continental GT Supersport</h2><p>You may be surprised to find a very refined British luxury vehicle on the list. Despite the fact that McMahon sports a suit and tie almost all of the time, he resembles the average man in many respects. That contradicts the perception of Bentley owners. Many assume he enjoys the flawless ride quality and the ferocious twin-turbo W12 engine that propels the big vehicle from 0 to 62 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom>Rolls-Royce Phantom</h2><p>McMahon has a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which many deem <a href=#>the pinnacle of British luxury automobiles</a>. Due to the fact that each Rolls-Royce is laden with customization options and color combinations, its real selling price is tailored specifically. It has been rumored that McMahon paid $450,000 for his, although the contents are unknown. The large V12 engine propels this heavy car from 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds, which is not bad.</p><h2 id=gmc-yukon-xl>GMC Yukon XL</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This car's presence in <a href=#>Vince McMahon's collection</a> demonstrates his passion for automobiles. This is because the GMC Yukon XL is an incredible marvel. The GMC Yukon XL has the most horsepower in its class at 420hp. The offered 6.2L V8 engine provides drivers with both the power they desire and the power they require. In addition, it has a road-dominant attitude. The length has been increased by 6.1 inches, giving the Yukon a longer, slimmer body that is emphasized by horizontal leading lines.</p><p>The angular form gives the Yukon a more contemporary appearance than the boxy appearance of earlier iterations. This automobile adds another ludicrous star to Vince McMahon's collection. In the following years, it is anticipated that there will be even more astounding additions to the boss's car collection.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Talk Show Royalty Garage: Inside Ellen DeGeneres' Massive Car Collection<span style=font-weight:400></span></a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JGuru</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5dmmpqqo2K2r3nVoqWcnV2isK6tx6ilrGWdlsC0tdWeZJynnKGypMDIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
