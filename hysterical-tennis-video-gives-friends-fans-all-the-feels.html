Loyal fans know that these are the two nicknames she has for herself, and it quickly became apparent that this fun and sarcastic video depicted Courteney Cox in a match against... herself! Fans just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">can't separate her identity from that of Monica Gellar, </a>and there were many Friends episodes that quickly flooded the minds of her fans.</p><h2 id=the-fabulously-funny-video>The Fabulously Funny Video</h2><p>The video itself was as funny as it gets. Courteney hit the court with an epic matchup against her alter ego.</p><p>One version of herself, seemingly the 'Monica,' was very confident and seemed ready to slam the tennis ball with ferociousness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other version of Cox appeared visibly stressed, yet determined, and her face was covered in beads of sweat as she gave this match her all.</p><p>This was all set to the sounds of The Eye Of The Tiger, and the build up was epic. The ball was whipped and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the competition was very real.</a></p><p>So were the nostalgic Friends memories that came rushing back...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox Sends â€˜Friendsâ€™ Fans Monica Vibes By Cooking Up A Storm</a></span></p><h2 id=fans-see-monica>Fans See Monica</h2><p>Courteney had a feeling this video would embarrass her daughter, and hysterically captioned this Instagram post by saying; "<span>CC vs Cece&nbsp;<a class=xil3i href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#courtonthecourts</a><a class=xil3i href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#embarssingmom</a><a class=xil3i href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#sorrycoco</a>.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her fans didn't think this was embarrassing at all - in fact, they thought it was pretty fantastic. Even without trying, Courteney Cox still oozes Monica Gellar vibes, and she is unmistakably still closely connected with the legendary role that she played on the sitcom.</p><p>Friends fans just can't get enough.</p><p>There are a series of episodes that resembled this fierce competitiveness; two of which immediately resonated with her fans.</p><p>One was the episode called;&nbsp;The One With Chandler's Work Laugh, during which Monica Gellar was playing tennis against Chandler's boss and his wife. She was so competitive that she&nbsp;was eventually forced to throw the game to keep Chandler in the 'good books' at work.</p><p>The other episode that fans connected this video to was The One In Barbados,&nbsp;where she faced off against Mike in a fierce game of ping pong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans were quick to make mention of these connections as they flooded her page with comments such as; "itâ€™s like Barbados all over again!"&nbsp; Another fan wrote: "Winner gets a Geller cup," which referenced the touch football match in The One With The Football.</p><p>Other comments included; "Courtney vs Monica Gellar!" as well as; "CC is totally giving me onica vibes in the episode where sheâ€™s playing tennis against chandlerâ€™s boss ðŸ˜½," and "haha this is hilarious! thank you for making my day with this." and "thank you for the Monica vibes!&nbsp; We love you!"</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Friends': Monica's 10 Best Episodes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaqK2iqbKvsdhmmqiwXZ3GtMDEq6CcmZxiwaa6zaKqZq6ZmbKwecairZ6rXZu%2FqrHNnapmnpGjwG6ty6VkraCVYrOmscusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
