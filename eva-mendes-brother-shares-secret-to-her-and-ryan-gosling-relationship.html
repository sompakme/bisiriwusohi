It’s communication and understanding as well. They’re soulmates.”</p><p>Mendez was thrilled to watch the 2024 Oscars where his brother-in-law Gosling, 43, was <a href=#>nominated for</a> Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his role in<i> Barbie</i>. He was also expected to take the stage and <a href=#>perform a song</a> from the smash-hit movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Eva-Mendes-Brother-Shares-Secret-to-Her-and-Ryan-Gosling-Relationship-925-927.jpg><p>While Gosling walked the red carpet <a href=#>with his sister</a> <strong>Mandi Gosling</strong>, Mendes, 50, showed her support on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> by sharing a photo outside of her partner’s dressing room.</p><p>“Always by my man,” she wrote before the show began inside the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. Mendez has been on an acting hiatus since 2014, and famously opts not to attend red carpet events with her man.</p><p>While Mendez wasn’t sharing the couple’s plans for Oscar Sunday, he predicted his sister and Gosling would be focused on being close to their two daughters Esmeralda, 9, and Amada, 7.</p><p>“[They are] always, family first,” Mendez told <i>Us</i>. “What else do you have in life if you don’t have family?” As a source recently told <i>Us</i> for a cover story, the couple “are trying to keep their daughters’ lives as normal as possible and don’t want them growing up in Hollywood.”</p><p>When asked about being an uncle, Mendez was quick to gush over his two nieces.</p><p>“They’re young and they’re crazy and they’re wild so it’s like I just want to stand back and say, ‘Hi, how are you doing, but leave,’” he joked. “I’m not much into taking care or babysitting.”</p><p>When asked if he wants his sister and Gosling to have more kids, Mendez replied, “I think this is good for now.”</p><p>While watching the 2024 Oscars telecast, Mendez opted to wear the same Gucci suit he wore to the 2024 SAG Awards, an event where he was able to run into Gosling.</p><p>As award season comes to an end, Mendez isn’t the least bit surprised that Gosling received so much recognition for his role as Ken.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They didn’t think it was going to be a billion-dollar movie,” he told <i>Us</i>. “I can see that it made that much. You either love it or you hate it and obviously a lot more people loved it.</p><p>Mendez added, “I had a good time watching it.”</p><p><i>With reporting by Andrea Simpson</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaerpFiuqa6w56qZpqipMGpsdFmqqGZoprAbr%2FEnKmerF2pvG60xKtkmqaUYr%2B6rc1mnqirnJ67qHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
