Most would think that with this level of notoriety and wealth,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cardi B has everything she wants from life.</a> This week, she revealed that not only does she want more, but she wants to achieve billionaire status the same way that her idols Rihanna and Jay-Z have done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> reports that Cardi B's greatest influence comes from Jay-Z and Rihanna, since they both came from humble beginnings and have since become self-made millionaires in their own right. The time has come for her to do the same, and it appears nothing will stop her from achieving this level of success.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Most Influential Rappers In The World</a></span></p><p>Achieving worldwide attention for her exploitative lyrics and seductive moves in her hit single WAP, Cardi B took the spotlight as the money rolled in.&nbsp; Riding on the waves of the success of this album, 2020 also saw income growth with the release of her&nbsp;own sneaker brand, and she continued shattered Billboard records well into 2021.&nbsp; The start of this year came with the announcement that Cardi B was&nbsp;pursuing her first-ever starring role in a movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By all accounts, her<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> current net worth of $30 million</a> is poised to grow exponentially with the passing of each year. Most people would consider $30 million to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a substantial amount of money,</a> and would be satisfied enough with this fortune to take time off and enjoy the fruits of their labor, but not Cardi B. She has her sights set firmly on achieving billionaire status in the same manner that Rihanna and Jay-Z did before her.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> quotes Cardi B as saying; "“I just feel like they’re so influential because Rihanna comes from a country, a Caribbean country, that my parents came from and she’s a whole billionaire...That's what I want. I want to be a billion-dollar woman. I want to build a huge brand.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to declare<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Jay-Z as another source of influence</a> and inspiration by saying; “He's from the hood just like me. He's from the hood and this man's a whole billionaire," she said...And that's just all about strategy and that's just all about shaking hands, that's just all about putting plans together.”</p><p>It seems that Cardi B's plans are being put together through this statement, as well. With her eyes locked on the billion dollar prize, the world is sure to be seeing more projects and endorsements by Cardi B.
