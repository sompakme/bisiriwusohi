Kristen Wiig and her fiancé, Avi Rothman, welcomed twins via surrogate earlier this year, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.
The news comes just one month after the comedian hinted that she had become a mother while hosting Saturday Night Live in May.
“This is the Mother’s Day show, and at SNL, it’s a very special time to celebrate moms,” Wiig said at the time. “Unfortunately, probably like a lot of you, I can’t be with my mom on this Mother’s Day."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So, I hope it’s OK, I would like to tell her I love her.”</p><p>The Bridesmaids star added, “I don’t know if I truly appreciated my mom the first 45 years of my life. But this year I’m feeling especially grateful for her advice, her love. I’m so thankful for all the things she’s taught me, like preparing me to be a mom myself.”</p><p>Wiig listed one of those lessons as breastfeeding before she held up a plate of cooked chicken breasts. “Babies love that chicken, she would always say that,” the actress joked.</p><p>Us confirmed in August 2019 that Wiig and Rothman, 42, were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">engaged after three years of dating</a>.

I think women put that pressure on themselves, maybe even more than society does, but if you’re the single girl at the wedding, you know someone is going to ask you when you’re going to get married.”</p><p>Reporting by Brody Brown</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jLCgop9dlrulecWimKeblWKut7WMq6atoJ2Wu27DxKWaqKWVYsG4tc2sZK%2BhkWLAtr7RqJ6arJVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
