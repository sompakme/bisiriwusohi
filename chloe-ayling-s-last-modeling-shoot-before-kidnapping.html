Her most recent gig, as pictured here, featured the gorgeous model bearing it all for the camera with seductive smiles and revealing swimwear, at times carrying a Super Soaker to get the message across.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after arriving in Milan, Ayling was drugged, handcuffed, and stuffed into the trunk of a car where she was then taken to a remote Italian village and held ransom for six days.</p><p>Shortly after her abduction, the Black Death crime syndicate sent a ransom email to her modeling agency threatening to sell the model on the <a href=#>dark web</a> unless they were paid £270,000.</p><p>Ayling is certainly a rising star in the modeling world, but her agency couldn’t come up with the cash. They contacted police to try and help bring her home, as well as friends and family to help come up with the money.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ayling languished in a stone cottage in Borgia, Italy. Her suspected captor, Lukasz Herba, a Polish handyman who moved to the UK a few years ago, had her chained to the furniture for six days, all the while posting photos of her to the dark web and threatening to sell her to the Russian mafia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>MODELS VICTORIA'S SECRET SHOULD BE CONSIDERING</a></strong></p><p>Or did he? Local residents of the small village reported nothing amiss, believing the pair to be a couple going on a romantic getaway. The cottage is advertised for tourists seeking a nature-oriented vacation, and she was even spotted walking around the village unsupervised.</p><p>Cesare Prati, the owner of the cottage who rented to Herba, couldn’t understand why Ayling wouldn’t have called for help if she had been in distress. "In Viu there's police and carabinieri, it's full of people. Why didn't she ask for help, I don't understand," he said in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with iNews</a>.</p><p>Raising suspicions further is how Ayling was eventually released without any ransom being paid. After being handed over to the British consulate in Manila, a small note attached to her said she was being released "because she is a mother". She was then taken back to the UK.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After returning home Ayling has already booked topless photo shoots and signed a deal with celebrity agency Kruger Crowne who is arranging after-dinner speeches for £2,000 each. She’s also trying to spin the notoriety of her ordeal into landing a spot on <a href=#><i>Celebrity Big Brother</i></a>, something her agent says she’s always aspired to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yktMuonGaZqaG2r7PSZqOaq6RiurCwxKWgp59dqLWwu9NmmZ6en6eybrfInaWaqKCeu6h7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
