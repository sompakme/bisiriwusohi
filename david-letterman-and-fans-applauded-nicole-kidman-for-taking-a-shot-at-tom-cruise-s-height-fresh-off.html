Fans of Dave have seen numerous examples, and that includes a conversation with <strong><a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a></strong>, fresh off her divorce from <strong><a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong>.</p><p>Letterman wasted no time bringing up the matter. We'll take a closer look at how Kidman reacted, and how she even managed to squeeze in a joke about Tom Cruise's height, one the fans and Dave absolutely loved.</p><p>We'll also take a closer look at the fan reaction to the interview, and how Tom Cruise reacted differently to Kidman being mentioned in a 60 Minutes chat following their divorce.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-05t110052-637.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Noticed Olivia Munn Getting Nervous When She Realized Her Wardrobe With David Letterman Was Too Revealing">Fans Noticed Olivia Munn Getting Nervous When She Realized Her Wardrobe With David Letterman Was Too Revealing</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>During Olivia Munn's interview with David Letterman, fans caught the actress looking at herself on the monitor in distress.</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman-stunned-david-letterman-and-the-late-show-crowd-after-she-made-a-short-joke-about-tom-cruise>Nicole Kidman Stunned David Letterman And The Late Show Crowd After She Made A Short Joke About Tom Cruise</h2><p>Credit To Nicole Kidman for taking on the interview with David Letterman, despite the fact that the media was all over her divorce at the time with Tom Cruise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Letterman didn't make life easier for Kidman, instantly bringing up the divorce at the start. Even Paul Shaffer stepped in and was angry with the host. Dave says at the start, "You look fantastic. I heard you're getting divorced, how's that going?" Shaffer steps in, "Hey, hey, what are you doing." Letterman continues, "I don't know what to do."</p><p>Letterman goes on to say that he assumes things are alright given that Kidman showed up for the interview. Kidman still maintains a smile and laughs off Letterman's divorce talk, despite the fact that she was clearly uncomfortable.</p><p>Kidman would go on to say that she doesn't know how to "take everything." But would continue on with a joke nobody expected, stating she could now wear heals. The audience had a blast at the moment and Letterman himself was genuinely laughing.</p><p>The moment can be relived at the start in the video below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ttweb_cybill-shepherd-refused-to-wear-clothes-during-an-interview-with-david-letterman_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Cybill Shepherd Refused To Wear Clothes During An Incredibly Awkward Interview With David Letterman">Cybill Shepherd Refused To Wear Clothes During An Incredibly Awkward Interview With David Letterman</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Stars usually get dressed up for talk show appearances but Cybill Shepherd refused to get dressed at all before David Letterman interviewed her.</p><p>Kidman then says "now we move on," to which Dave hilariously answers, "that's gonna cost you."</p><p>As expected, Letterman continued to bring up the topic. Kidman flips the tables and then asks Dave about the details relating to his divorce.</p><p>Ultimately, Kidman wanted to change topics given that the kids were involved as well.

When she first burst onto the Hollywood scene in Days of Thunder (at least that was the first film I saw her in,) I thought she was just Mrs. Tom Cruise, riding his coattails. But after I watched her in The Others, I realized how much of an acting talent she really was!"</p><p>The fan continues, "After seeing her in this interview then I realized that she was as genuine as she is talented. I loved the crack about wearing heels again because I have been in relationships where I've had to play a silent partner, and it's such a liberating feeling when one finds the strength to move on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-04t130751-515.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Led Zeppelin Let A Detail Slip About Their Encounter With Elvis Presley During Their Interview With David Letterman">Led Zeppelin Let A Detail Slip About Their Encounter With Elvis Presley During Their Interview With David Letterman</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Led Zeppelin kept things brief discussing Elvis alongside David Letterman, but they let quite the detail slip about his entourage.</p><p>Other fans appreciated the wittiness between Letterman and Kidman throughout the interview. One thing is for sure, Kidman did a much better job at handling the issue compared to Tom Cruise.</p><h2 id=tom-cruise-wasn-39-t-as-kind-when-nicole-kidman-was-mentioned-following-their-divorce>Tom Cruise Wasn't As Kind When Nicole Kidman Was Mentioned Following Their Divorce</h2><p>It was a different reality for the actor during his appearance on 60 Minutes Australia. <a href=#>Tom Cruise told the interviewer he stepped out of line asking about Nicole Kidman</a>. The interviewer referred to Kidman as the love of Tom's life. The actor didn't take kindly to the reference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tom-cruise-interview.png><p>He said, "You're stepping over a line now. You know you are. Peter, you want to know, take responsibility for what you want to know. I'm telling you right now, put you manners back in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interviewer Peter Overton did apologize for the question but years later, looking back at it, he still does not regret asking. As for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, both have clearly moved on today, and do not discuss their relationship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqtsdOtnKulkaN6orrDZp2apqNirrG8y5qsnZ2UYruqr86lnGajmZm6orqMn6arZaSWuKq6xmaYZquYpMFurdNmq6ilXZi%2FtrXSnqpmoJWetKnAjJ%2BpnquYYrynsoytn56homKxqsLOq5qeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
