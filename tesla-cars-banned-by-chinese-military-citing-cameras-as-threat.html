The latest upset to come out of China has Tesla backed into a corner and is poised to create financial upset on a large scale. A recent report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aljazeera </a>quotes Bloomberg as saying this was triggered by issues with security. China "has concerns that the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the cars’ in-built cameras </a>in a way the Chinese government can’t see or control." The only solution in the eyes of the Chinese government, is to prevent Tesla vehicles from being allowed anywhere near the military base. In order to ensure the highest levels of safety and security are maintained, the vehicles are no longer permitted within the boundaries of any military establishment. Employees of the military received notice of their new restrictions, and Tesla will surely feel the pinch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Investor Sues Elon Musk, Tesla Over "Erratic" Tweets</a></span></p><p>Tesla has always been quick to boast the effectiveness of their cameras and high-tech security features, never assuming that the very technology that sets them apart from other manufacturers could effectively be the sole reason they are blocked from certain regions.</p><p>In this particular case, the region they're being banned from is one they rely heavily on. China is the world's largest consumer of electronic vehicles, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk relies heavily on the sale of Tesla vehicles in China</a> to continue to expand the Tesla Brand. Without the support of Chinese consumers, the bulk of Tesla's market will surely suffer, and there's just no telling what sort of impact this move can make on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the future of Tesla's success.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment the Chinese government is only concerned with possible security breaches which correlated directly with their military bases and they remain focused on this singularly. However, if other countries adopt this same mentality, the list of regions that could essentially follow suit and ban <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tesla</a> vehicles altogether, could have an absolutely devastating effect on Elon Musk's corporation.</p><p>Tesla boasts a number of cameras mounted both internally and on the external elements of their vehicles. The cameras are intended to support the advanced technology which senses the precise location of the vehicle and the level of attention being paid by the driver. These are critical to the full self driving features which set Tesla apart from other car manufacturers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That very same advanced technology is what is currently considered to be the biggest wildcard for the Chinese government. Unwilling to risk that the car's cameras could be used to collect location details, video camera coverage, audio recordings, and other critical data belonging to the Chinese military, the ban will remain in full force, and Tesla is effectively experiencing the first, of what is likely to be many restrictions.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk Tweets About Potential Product Offered By Tesla</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AlJazeera via Bloomberg</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mercury News</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OeqqWZXZius7%2BMm5inppWZeqS0yKecrJ1dorattdOaqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
