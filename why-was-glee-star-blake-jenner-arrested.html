In his early teenage years, he starred in many TV commercials before moving up the ladder. His first appearance was in the 2010 short Fresh 2 Death. He later went on to appear in the TV series Melissa & Joey and the film Cousin Sarah in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just a year later, he managed to land a life-changing role as Ryder Lynn in the Fox musical comedy-drama show called Glee.

Everybody Wants Some!! (2016), American Animals (2018), Billy Boy (2017), and the TV series What/If.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href=# title="Why Are There So Many 'Glee' References In 'The Girl From Plainville'?">Why Are There So Many 'Glee' References In 'The Girl From Plainville'?</a></span></p><p>Starring in such a wide range of shows and movies has allowed Jenner to build up his work portfolio and at the same time, build his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.5 million net worth</a> that he sits on today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-was-glee-star-blake-jenner-arrested>Why Was Glee Star Blake Jenner Arrested?</h2><p>More recently, the 29-year-old actor has been getting himself in hot water. So, what exactly has Blake Jenner been arrested for?</p><p>Earlier last month, Blake Jenner was arrested for driving under the influence in California and obtained DUI charges. On July 9th, he was pulled over after officers spotted him failing to come to a stop at a red light.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=# title="What Has 'Glee' Star Dianna Agron Been Working On Recently?">What Has 'Glee' Star Dianna Agron Been Working On Recently?</a></span></p><p>Once pulled over, Jenner apparently displayed "objective signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication", according to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burbank Police Department</a>. After performing a field sobriety test, he was charged. He is due to appear in court at a later date and was later released from custody after being arrested. Since then, no more news has been released regarding the event.</p><p>Fans certainly weren't shy about airing their opinions on the matter online. One fan wrote:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, it seems some fans aren't feeling best pleased about his actions. Maybe some believe that this could be a warning to prevent further mishaps.</p><h2 id=he-also-publicly-addressed-domestic-violence-allegations-in-2020>He Also Publicly Addressed Domestic Violence Allegations In 2020</h2><p>However, his recent driving incident isn't the only controversy the young actor has been caught up in. Just two years ago in 2020, Jenner took to his Instagram to post a heartfelt message, addressing domestic violence allegations concerning his ex-wife Melissa Benoist.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">heartfelt explanation</a> spanned a total of six pages, and it seemed as though Jenner clearly had a lot to get off his chest in regard to the situation. He began by explaining that he has been reflecting on how to handle the situation and that he now felt that it was an issue that needed to be addressed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Throughout that time, I reflected on a period in my life that I had previously kept in the darkness out of shame and fear, but I know this is something that needs to be addressed, not just publicly, but also privately with the individual directly affected and with myself."</p><p>He then proceeds to open up about his former relationship with his wife, explaining elements of their relationship for the public. He actually dives into quite some detail.</p><p>"When I was 20 years old, I met a woman and we fell in love. I didn't realize the magnitude of it back then, but in retrospect, as great as the love that was shared between us, the shared brokenness that stemmed from our childhoods proved to be greater."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The post then dives into further depth and detail. His ex-wife also opened up about the situation, detailing on a video on Instagram how she thought she'd 'never be sharing a story like this'.</p><p>She has since gone on to share her side of the story in hopes of helping other people in the same situation as her. Since then, neither side seems to of spoken publicly about the issue again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdrK60ecalnJ5lo6mus3nBpZiknV2fsq%2B6xKtkmqqimsC1scNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
