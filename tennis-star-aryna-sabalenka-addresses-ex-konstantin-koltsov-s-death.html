This morning the same. So I know what she’s going through. I know the entire situation, what is happening.”</p><p>She continued, “That for me is a little bit shocking also to go through that because, at the end, she’s my best friend and I don’t want her to suffer. It’s a very tough situation. At the same point, playing against her, it’s also uncomfortable.”</p><p>Former No. 1 tennis pro <a href=#><strong>Caroline Wozniacki</strong> </a>added, “I can’t even imagine what she’s going through right now, I’m saying that. I’m also tearing up. It’s such a terrible situation. It’s so hard. I reached out to her and I told her that I was here if she needed anything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZ6jtrR50q2Yq2WRp8avrYysmJuZnJq7rK2MmpudqpWowKa%2FjJ6vZqOfo8C1rc2toKdlm6S5tb%2FOr6pmnJWWwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
