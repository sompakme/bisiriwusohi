The rapper had seven songs on the Billboard 100 at one time, and this was even before her debut album was released in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like most superstars, there have been several rumors surrounding Nicki Minaj and her personal life. A number of people believe she has a secret relationship with one or more famous rappers who are also her label mates. Minaj also underwent a pretty public breakup recently, and she wasn’t afraid to admit that she was hurt by the demise of the relationship. Some people even say that Minaj doesn’t write all of her catchy lyrics. It’s pretty obvious that Nicki has had some enhancements in the posterior area, but there are also speculations that other parts of her body may not be completely authentic.</p><p>Obviously, these rumors haven’t stopped the Trinidadian rapper from taking the music world by storm with her outrageous outfits, colorful wigs and attention-getting makeup. However, there are still probably some things you didn’t know when it comes to one of the most successful female rappers of all time.&nbsp;Here are 10 naughty secrets about Nicki Minaj.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicki-has-15-alter-egos>10. Nicki Has 15 Alter Egos</h2><p>Aside from being a “Barbie,” Nicki has several alter egos that she often refers to in her songs. For instance, Roman is an angry British boy who is pretty aggressive. She even named one of her musical projects <i>Roman’s Revenge,</i> to further showcase this alter ego. However, Nicki Teresa is a fabulous yet benevolent woman who is both kind and fashionable. Before she settled on her moniker, she was also known as <a href=#>Cookie</a>, a nickname that is the embodiment of a talented girl with a rough edge or two, who is pretty and approachable. Not surprisingly, this description still seems fitting for Minaj, since she is known for being both brash and especially feminine.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-insulted-justin-bieber-s-member>9. Nicki Minaj Insulted Justin Bieber’s… Member</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minaj threw a “little” jab when she insinuated that <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> wasn’t very well endowed. The two collaborated on the song <i>Beauty And The Beat</i>, and Bieber allegedly tried to get a little flirtatious on set. Nicki stated that during their performance together, the young pop star likely didn’t come in direct contact with her when the two were dancing. This was largely due to the fact that Nicki was wearing a tulle, flared skirt, but the rapper also alluded to the fact that Justin Bieber couldn’t “reach” her. Of course, Minaj is known for her sex appeal, but that doesn’t mean she wants everyone in the business to be familiar with her alluring ways.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-s-song-the-boys-was-inspired-by-her-personal-life>8. Nicki’s Song <i>The Boys</i>&nbsp;Was Inspired By Her Personal Life</h2><p>The content for her song <i>The Boys </i>was inspired by the fact that Minaj witnessed her father abusing her mother physically and verbally. Nicki’s father was an alcoholic and even attempted to burn the family house down, which was part of the reason Nicki went to live with her grandmother when she was a small child. The song talks about a guy who is so consumed with material things that he leaves the woman he loves damaged. The woman then takes her revenge. Minaj always wanted to help her mother feel empowered, and felt that her success as a musician could help her mom live the life she truly deserves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=nicki-treats-her-stuffed-animals-like-her-children>7. Nicki Treats Her Stuffed Animals Like Her Children</h2><p>The rapper and singer travels with about seven stuffed animals any time she goes out of town. She treats the toys as if they are her children, and admits that she talks to the animals when she is alone. While this is pretty strange, it’s not the weirdest thing we’ve heard of a celebrity doing, and it’s not hurting anyone, so Minaj gets a pass for this one. However, she’s pretty serious about keeping her stuffed animals safe. She even offered $50,000 as a reward for anyone who found her pink stuffed monkey, Oscar, when she lost “him” at the airport.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-took-nude-selfies-in-the-shower>6. Nicki Took Nude Selfies In The Shower</h2><p>Almost everyone remembers the time, not so long ago, when Nicki took a few selfies in the shower. She showed off her curves without giving away too much, and brought attention to her long tresses. Since Minaj has been known for wearing wigs and hairpieces in various colors, she likely felt the need to prove that she does have a beautiful head of natural hair. Some would say that the nude pics (with all her unmentionables strategically covered) were a clever way to get the attention of her fans in order to promote her new hair products. In a caption for one of the pictures, Minaj states that she’s trying out her new hair moisturizer to make sure it works well. Smart marketing, indeed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-inspired-her-ex-boyfriend-s-tattoo>5. Nicki Minaj Inspired Her Ex-Boyfriend’s Tattoo</h2><p>Minaj’s ex boyfriend Safaree, who was in a relationship with the rapper for over 10 years, got a tattoo that looks like Nicki’s face on his chest. The two claimed they were best friends for years, and Safaree even appeared on stage as Nicki’s hype man at many of her concerts. In 2014, when it was announced that the alleged couple were parting ways, things got messy. Both Safaree and Nicki went on separate radio interviews to discuss their breakup without making the other look too bad. Nicki even had to stop and collect herself during an interview with <a href=#>Angie Martinez</a>, where she explained that the breakup was <a href=#>truly affecting</a> her and that this was a real part of her life that people were insensitive towards.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-never-slept-with-lil-wayne-allegedly>4. Nicki Minaj Never Slept With Lil Wayne… Allegedly</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minaj has made it clear in several of her songs that she and <a href=#>Lil Wayne</a> are nothing more than friends and business partners. However, it seems that her loyalties run pretty deep for the Young Money CEO. When Lil Wayne was in a feud with other Young Money executives concerning the release of his album, Minaj banned these executives from coming to a party of hers. This definitely sounds like something one would do for a boyfriend. Minaj also bought Lil Wayne a car for his birthday one year. Interesting! There was also that time when Nicki Minaj gave Lil Wayne a pretty intricate lap dance.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-may-have-a-baby>3. Nicki May Have A Baby</h2><p>Media Takeout states that Minaj may have had a baby with her long-term boyfriend Safaree Samuels, when the two were in high school. There are pictures that depict a young Nicki Minaj with what looks like a baby bump. There isn’t any more confirmed information on the alleged pregnancy, but of course, people have their speculations. Some believe that Nicki and Safaree gave their child up for adoption. Others think that the former couple simply prefer to raise their child outside of the spotlight. There have also been speculations that Minaj had an abortion when she was younger. One thing is for sure; there are some parts of the rapper’s life that she’d like to keep private, since she hasn’t spoken publicly on this rumor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-and-drake-are-secretly-dating>2. Nicki Minaj And Drake Are Secretly Dating</h2><p>This “secret” has been a rumor for years. The fact that <a href=#>Drake</a> has stated in several songs that he’d gladly marry Nicki doesn’t diffuse the rumor at all. The media has long reported that the two rappers have a chemistry that is hard to hide. Allegedly, the “couple” have also been seen in a few suspicious positions recently. The two have some pretty alluring moments during their stage performances, and Minaj has been known to give Drake a pretty entertaining lap dance or two. Nicki Minaj has also mentioned in a few of her lyrics that she would marry Drake, and the two have had some pretty sweet Twitter exchanges. Perhaps it’s all just a smart marketing ploy to keep fans interested.</p><p></p><h2 id=nicki-minaj-is-attracted-to-women>1. Nicki Minaj Is Attracted To Women</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Minaj has alluded to the fact that she likes women on several occasions. She has stated that she finds women beautiful, and even talks about the female form in several of her songs. However, Nicki Minaj seemed to <a href=#>change her tune</a> a little during an interview with <i>Rolling Stone </i>in 2014. She reiterated that she does find women sexy, but doesn’t want to lie and say that she dates women. It’s pretty obvious that Minaj allowed fans to think that she was bisexual in the beginning of her career in order to grow her fan base and attract more attention to her musical talent. She hasn’t said much else about her sexuality since then.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>celebuzz.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>rap-up.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>advocate.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2jrrazx62wZqyYnruov4yypq5llJ6xr8CMpKWor12Wr7DB02aloqObnnqutc2aoWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
