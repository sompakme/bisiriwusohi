Based on the fact this is an open investigation, the Beverly Hills Police Department has no further information to provide.”</p><p>The Tennessee Bureau of Investigations is currently looking into the matter, and<a href=#> told Fox 13 Memphis in a statement </a>that “as with any matter potentially involving the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, our Agents first work in the spirit of due diligence, to determine whether a crime occurred and whether it occurred in Tennessee.”</p><p>The statement continues, “At this point, in this matter, we’ve yet to determine that to be the case. The work, however, to review potential evidence that might suggest otherwise continues. At this point, the TBI has not opened an official case in connection to this matter.”</p><p>In her February 7 court documents, Elvis Presley’s only daughter said she was “shocked and horrified and sick to my stomach” when she discovered the images on a computer belonging to her fourth husband. (The pair married in 2006, but Presley filed for divorce last June after claiming that the music producer “took advantage” of her finances.)</p><p>Lockwood’s lawyer, Jeff Sturman, denied Presley’s claims in a statement to <i>Us Weekly,</i> calling the singer’s filing “very unfortunate and inappropriate.”</p><p>“Ms. Presley and her lawyers undoubtedly knew that their highly sensational, inaccurate and unproven claims would be of great interest to the media, which would disseminate Ms. Presley’s inaccurate story as a result,” the statement reads. “To make matters worse, Ms. Presley failed to disclose very important information in the papers she filed in the Family Law Court and the things she failed to disclose are directly related to her inflammatory claims against Mr. Lockwood.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Mr. Lockwood is not going to publicly disclose very negative information about Ms. Presley to retaliate,” he continued. “Mr. Lockwood and his lawyers did not choose to litigate these personal matters in the press. Therefore, while Mr. Lockwood denies the truth of what Ms. Presley chose to put in the press, he has no further statement at this time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWeq6t0aKcZqiimsCtsdisZKGto5eur7CMm5yippditq%2FCxKyrop%2BRqbKlecWoqWabmJ65pXnAm6ysnV2sgXeDl2luaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
