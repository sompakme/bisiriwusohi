They also revealed the cause of death at the same time. “It saddens our hearts to announce that Anna Shay, a loving mother, grandmother, charismatic star, and our brightest ray of sunshine, has passed away at the early age of 62 from a stroke,” the statement read, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> reports.</p><p>“Anna taught us many life lessons on how not to take life too seriously and to enjoy the finer things,” it continued. “Her impact on our lives will be forever missed but never forgotten.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What The Cast Of Bling Empire: New York Was Doing Before Their Reality TV Fame</a></span></p><p>Anna is the daughter of billionaires Edward Shay and Ai-San Shay, who made a fortune in arms and defence trade through their company Pacific Architects and Engineers. The couple’s children went on to inherit shares of the company, which Ana later sold for over a billion. Her personal <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth was reportedly $600 million</a> at the time of her death.</p><p>During her life, Anna married and divorce four times. She’s survived by one child, a son, Kenny, 27, who had brief appearances on Bling Empire alongside his famous mother.</p><h2 id=why-anna-left-instagram-the-year-before-her-death>Why Anna Left Instagram The Year Before Her Death</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna didn’t publicly disclose if she was having health issues prior to her death. But a sign that she may have had a lot going on in her personal life is that she hadn’t been active on Instagram since December 2022. The eccentric heiress didn’t make a formal announcement that she was stepping away from social media. In fact, her last post was made during the holidays, and it didn’t give any indication Anna was leaving the public eye.</p><p>“Wishing everyone happy holiday …May all your dreams come true,” Anna captioned her final Instagram post on December 3. It was accompanied by an image of Anna and a friend, presumably at a Christmas party.</p><p>“And a very special Thank you to all at the Netflix,” Anna added, which seemed to imply that her reality television relationship with the streaming giant was going to continue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anna was part of the original Bling Empire cast, which debuted on Netflix in January 2021. The show follows a group of wealth Asian and Asian-American socialites in Los Angeles. She quickly became a fan favorite on the show, largely for her big personality, sharp fashion sense, and fun-loving attitude.</p><p>While Anna’s decision to leave social media prior to her death may be suspicious, given that she’s been in the public eye so much in the last few years, the heiress did live much of her life outside of fame. Her absence from Instagram may have signaled a simple desire for more privacy, and may not be connected to her health.</p><p>For now, it’s unclear how Bling Empire will address Anna’s death. But if one thing is for sure, it’s that her absence will be deeply felt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpaGenHqmuc%2BiqZ5lo6mus3nAp6WaZaOdrrp5wJuYp5yfo7Klecinqq2Zl6eurnnToZxmsZWWv26uxJ%2Bmq51dnbKzecOemK2gXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
