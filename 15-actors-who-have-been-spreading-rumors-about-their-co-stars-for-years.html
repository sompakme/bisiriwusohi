Even if we don't like to admit that, it's true. We eat that stuff up. The trouble with drama between the stars is that the majority of it seems to be manufactured. Since gossip and fights between celebrities sells, anything that could be spun as animosity usually is. This is especially true with actresses. They seem to be particularly vulnerable to rumors about fights on set. Well, we want to try and sift through all the fake drama and pull out only the real stuff. Not all of this stuff is salacious either. Some of the rumors are just things that one star has been spreading about another that the other denies. In some cases, the rumors have been proven to be true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When you work closely with another person for an extended period of time, there is often some clashing, especially when the people involved have bold personalities. As we all know, actors have very bold personalities. But, when you live and die in the public eye, why spread rumors? Doesn't that kind of activity have a chance of blowing up in the spreader's face? Well, yeah, but these are still humans we're talking about. While some have said things they probably shouldn't have and regretted it, the ones on this list continue to say things that they probably shouldn't, so we doubt that they regret it. Here are 15 Actors Who Have Been Spreading Rumors About Their Co-Stars for Years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sly-stallone-and-richard-gere><strong>Sly Stallone And Richard Gere</strong></h2><p>We don't need to give you the details of the rumor; you know it. OK, fine. <a href=#>Richard Gere</a> allegedly had to have a gerbil extracted from his bum. It has created one of the most infamous Hollywood urban legends. Well, there was always a question about who started it. The rumor was that someone faxed a bunch of the tabloids with this story. So, who did that? No one knows. Even if we don't know who started, though, we do know one person who makes sure people don't forget about it. Cue in&nbsp;<a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> talking about working with Gere on the set of The Lords of the Flatbush.</p><p>"We were rehearsing at Coney Island and it was lunchtime, so we decided to take a break, and the only place that was warm was in the backseat of a Toyota. I was eating a hotdog and he climbs in with a half a chicken covered in mustard with grease nearly dripping out of the aluminum wrapper. I said, 'That thing is going to drip all over the place.' He said, 'Don’t worry about it.' I said, 'If it gets on my pants you're gonna know about it.' He proceeds to bite into the chicken and a small, greasy river of mustard lands on my thigh. I elbowed him in the side of the head and basically pushed him out of the car. The director had to make a choice: one of us had to go, one of us had to stay. Richard was given his walking papers and to this day seriously dislikes me. He even thinks I'm the individual responsible for the gerbil rumor. Not true…but that's the rumor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kevin-smith-and-bruce-willis><strong>Kevin Smith And Bruce Willis</strong></h2><p>Like many huge stars, <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> has been known as a difficult actor for some time now. He's had complaints against him from other actors, directors, and producers. <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>&nbsp; has one critic who is all three of those things. When Smith cast Willis in the film Cop Out, he never imagined how hard it would be. Apparently, as soon as the film ended, during the wrap party, if you believe the reports, Smith started bad-talking Willis. In several interviews since, Smith has not held back, saying that Willis went out of his way to make his life miserable. "It was difficult," Smith said. "I've never been involved in a situation like that where, one component is not in the box at all. It was f**kin' soul crushing. I mean, a lot of people are gonna be like, 'Oh, you're just trying to blame the movie on him.' No, but I had no f**king help from this dude whatsoever."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-young-and-warren-beatty><strong>Sean Young And Warren Beatty</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Sean Young</a> has had drama follow her around basically every set she's ever stepped foot on. When she was working, she seemed to get into it with her costar on every film. There was the time when&nbsp;<a href=#>James Woods</a> sued her for harassment, claiming that the actress was stalking him and leaving disturbing things outside his home. Young denies this. The worst of all, in terms of rumors being spread, came from the set of Dick Tracy. Young has continued to claim that <a href=#>Warren Beatty</a>, director and star of the film, fired her after she turned down his advances. She said, “Basically, he sacked me because I did not want to go to bed with him. In the seven days we worked together, he just made s*xual advances. He tried to kiss me. I was unresponsive and kept joking with him about it. Like, ‘Ha, ha — what a ladies’ man you are.’ But I drew a clear line for him that I was not interested. It was not as if he got the hint. One time I had to say, ‘Stop it.’ I had to push him away.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-leguizamo-and-steven-seagal><strong>John Leguizamo And Steven Seagal</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Leguizamo</a> is not a shy guy. He's usually quite open in interviews and seems to have had a lot of fun throughout his career. Well, not on one film; and that's because of <a href=#>Steven Seagal</a>. This all stems from an incident on the set of Executive Decision. Seagal, known for his antics and getting overly physical with actors and stuntmen, put his reputation into action with Leguizamo.</p><p>In an interview, Leguizamo recalled the encounter, “We were in rehearsals for Executive Decision. I’m playing his Master Sergeant and we come in for rehearsals and he says, ‘I’m in command. Everything I say is law. Anybody doesn’t agree?’ I was like, ‘Bwahahaha.’ I started cracking up because he sounded like a retard and he came up and he Taekwondo’ed my a*s against the brick and he [hit me with his elbow],” Leguizamo recalled. “He’s six-foot-five and he caught me off guard and knocked all of the air out of me and I was like, ‘Why?! Why?!’ I really wanted to say how big and fat he was and that he runs like a girl, but I didn’t because all I could say was, ‘Why?!’ Why’d he slam me against the wall? We were rehearsing. What’s the big deal? Why can’t I call him names? If I can’t let it out, it’s going to build like a cancer.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-douglas-and-val-kilmer><strong>Michael Douglas And Val Kilmer</strong></h2><p>This one was a bit strange because the rumors about <a href=#>Val Kilmer</a> spread like wildfire, were then disputed and then admitted to. It all started when reporters asked <a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> about Kilmer's health. There were concerns and reports about the guy, so they asked one of his former co-stars about him. The former costar of The Ghost and the Darkness, Douglas, then said that Kilmer was "dealing with exactly what I had," referring to oral cancer. He also said that things weren't looking good for him, which screamed terminal to anyone listening. Douglas was asked about this a few times and never took back his statements, even after Kilmer denied them. Kilmer had gotten used to denying reports about his health, so this was nothing new. The people listening were not convinced, though. It wasn't until much later, after much denying and laughing about the thought of him being sick, that Kilmer responded to a question about the reports. And this time, he verified their truth. When speaking about Douglas' comments, Kilmer said, "He was probably trying to help me 'cause press probably asked where I was these days, and I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen although healing all the time… Because I don't sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather." It looks like some rumors are true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janet-hubert-and-will-smith><strong>Janet Hubert And Will Smith</strong></h2><p>Basically, the moment Janet Hubert left the cast of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, she's been flapping her lips about <a href=#>Will Smith</a>. Well, to be fair to the former Aunt Vivian, it was Smith who was the first to officially go public about their feud. Hubert had said some things under her breath and it was known that she left the show because of tension between her and the cast, but Smith came out and said the following a year after she left, "I can say straight up that Janet Hubert wanted the show to be The Aunt Viv of Bel Air Show, because I know she is going to dog me in the press. She has basically gone from a quarter of a million dollars a year to nothing. She's mad now but she's been mad all along. She said once, 'I've been in the business for 10 years and this snotty-nosed punk comes along and gets a show.'" For her part, Hubert has been saying that Smith never helped her and that the other stars get a better deal from the network. She had asked Will to help, but he denied her. Then, last year, more than 25 years later, Hubert showed that she still wasn't over the beef, bringing it up once again in a viral video post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-prinze-jr-and-keifer-sutherland><strong>Freddie Prinze Jr. And Keifer Sutherland</strong></h2><p>Ever since <a href=#>Freddie Prinze Jr.</a> has left the live-action acting world behind, he's not been shy about who he talks bad about. That's not to say that he does it often, but he hasn't held back about former 24 co-star, <a href=#>Keifer Sutherland</a>. A few years ago, while promoting Star Wars Rebels, Prinze Jr. talked about his time on the show and said, "It was terrible. I hated every moment of it. Kiefer was the most unprofessional dude in the world. That's not me talking trash, I'd say it to his face, I think everyone that's worked with him has said that." He then got even more specific saying, "I went and worked for <a href=#>Vince McMahon</a> at the WWE for Christ's sake and it was a crazier job than working with Kiefer, but, at least he was cool and tall. I didn't have to take my shoes off to do scenes with him, which they made me do. Just put the guy on an apple box or don't hire me next time. You know I'm 6 feet and he's 5'4.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julie-christie-and-donald-sutherland><strong>Julie Christie And Donald Sutherland</strong></h2><p>There's been a long persistent rumor in Hollywood that the s*x scene between <a href=#>Donald Sutherland</a> and Julie Christie in Don't Look Now was unsimulated. Now, much of this comes from the lips of Peter Bart, the editor of Variety. But some of the crew and even Christie haven't helped quell the rumors. When asked about it, Christie has never gone out of her way to deny the rumors. Instead, she gave ambiguous statements like, "I loved the squirming bits and all those things you don't see. It was just flesh squirming and rolling and touching, and God I thought it was absolutely lovely." Sutherland, conversely, has adamantly denied the account, saying that it was all fake and that anyone who says different either wasn't there or is lying for publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hardy-and-shia-labeouf><strong>Tom Hardy And Shia LaBeouf</strong></h2><p>Most of the rumors you hear one actor say about another are bad, both on the surface and under it. That's not the case for <a href=#>Tom Hardy</a> and <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf</a>, although Hardy seems to have a twinkle in his eye whenever he speaks of his former co-star. These rumors came about on the set of Lawless. Now, LaBeouf has butted heads with co-stars before and so has Hardy. We expected fireworks. After Lawless was made, LaBeouf had said that there was a familial feeling on set and that resulted in some physical confrontations as well. He had said that Hardy got physical with him and LaBeouf had to set him straight, saying that after he did that, "[Hardy] never did that roughhouse stuff with me again." That may seem unbelievable and maybe LaBeouf's comments were exaggerated, but then Hardy confirmed them, if only jokingly. When asked about it, Hardy said, "I got knocked out by Shia LaBeouf, actually… [It was] behind the scenes… He knocked me out sparko. Out cold. He's a bad, bad boy. He is. He's quite intimidating as well. He's a scary dude." What's unclear here is if Hardy is mocking the story or LaBeouf. Maybe it's both. Either way, John Hillcoat, the film's director, confirmed that there was a fight of sorts, saying, "There was definitely a fight between them. It escalated to the point where they had to both be restrained. But I was very pleased to hear it didn't go that way because I would hate to see the outcome." Guess we know who he thinks would win.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marlon-brando-and-val-kilmer><strong>Marlon Brando And Val Kilmer</strong></h2><p>Both <a href=#>Marlon Brando</a> and <a href=#>Val Kilmer</a> have or had reputations of being difficult actors to work with. Although they both had these reputations from early on in their careers, the stories from the set of The Island of Dr. Moreau really cemented them. The story of making The Island of Dr. Moreau is infinitely more interesting than the film itself. The rumors that have persisted since the film first started shooting include Kilmer being the ultimate primadonna (he even demanded that the shooting schedule be shortened by 60%) and Brando going slightly insane. Many co-stars have been saying that Kilmer is the biggest a*s in Hollywood and is impossible to work with. Apparently, Brando was just a madman. When he first saw a two-foot-tall actor on set, he decided that he wanted this actor to become his "mini me," demanding that&nbsp;the character should dress exactly like him and go wherever Brando went. He also tried to make his character into a half man half dolphin, and he wore an ice bucket on his head the entire film. Since Brando struggled mightily to learn his lines at this point in his career, he had an ear piece into which his lines would be delivered directly to him. The story goes that Brando would sometimes pick up stray signals from police radios and even once said "There's a robbery at Woolworths" during a scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dominic-monaghan-and-matthew-fox><strong>Dominic Monaghan And Matthew Fox</strong></h2><p>There were plenty of issues between the loud-mouthed <a href=#>Dominic Monaghan</a> and the cast and crew of Lost. The former hobbit had been in a relationship with co-star <a href=#>Evangeline Lilly</a> during shooting, and when that relationship went south, so too did his tenure on the show. At one point, things got really ugly between Monaghan and co-star&nbsp;<a href=#>Matthew Fox</a>. Fox had gotten into some legal trouble after a female bus driver accused him of drunkenly attacking her. He eventually forced the case out of court by hiring expensive lawyers, but Monaghan wasn't about to let people forget. When a fan asked Monaghan to help get Fox on Twitter, Monaghan tweeted that he wouldn't because Fox "beats women." When prodded on that point, Monaghan tweeted again, "He beats women. Not isolated incidents. Often." Fox was asked about these serious accusations, and he denied them saying, "In the 46 years I’ve been breathing on this planet, I have never hit a woman before. Never have, never will. I think there’s still gonna be a lot of people out there who’ll think it’s true no matter what."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=roseanne-and-john-goodman><strong>Roseanne And John Goodman</strong></h2><p>So, this story has since been taken down and the validity of the claims have been disputed, but we wanted to show it anyway, just in case it is true. When Roseanne was on the air, there were numerous rumors about drugs and violence on set. Yet, in all the discussions and interviews since, everyone has always played nice. But then, years after Roseanne went off the air, a forum post that was allegedly written by <a href=#>Roseanne Barr</a> herself made some startling accusations and started getting attention. Speaking about her ex-husband, <a href=#>Tom Arnold</a>, and ex-costar, <a href=#>John Goodman</a>, Roseanne wrote the following:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Both of them were huge addicts and I got caught in the middle of that. I used to look up Goodman's nose in the scenes we did together and see white powder all over in there. I tried to call everyone who could help John try to get off dope and booze. He hated me for that. He use to throw parties at his house each weekend and invite everyone on the show but me. I was very hurt at the fact that I wrote his part and his lines for him and he never appreciated the work I did for him at all. He used to come in and scream at the little kids and drink 'til he fell over and expect me to cover it all up for him, which I did. I was used to doing that, living with a drunk drug addict like Tom Arnold. I just tried to do the show and write the stories that I wanted to do on TV,&nbsp;despite the horrible stress and pain that both Tom and John caused me every single day on the set. I was relieved when Goodman left the show and couldn't wait to kill his character off, so that I never had to be forced to work with him ever again. Besides Tom, I have never met a more horrible person than John Goodman. He is lucky that he is such a great actor or I would have fired or killed him. He never said anything nice or complimentary to any other actor. He put his drunk fist through a wall over Michael Fishman's head when Michael was just six years old. I threatened him that I would go to the press more than once, and like all addicts, including his now best buddy Tom, that scared him. "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marcia-and-jan-brady><strong>Marcia And Jan Brady</strong></h2><p>Things haven't been right in Brady land for over a decade now. It all started when <a href=#>Maureen McCormick</a> (Marcia Brady) claimed that she and <a href=#>Eve Plumb</a> (Jan Brady) had a lesbian fling. Afterward, McCormick said that it was only a joke for "shock value." But then, a few years later in 2008, McCormick published her book, Here's the Story, which spoke again about the alleged relationship. When asked about it, McCormick said that she developed a crush on Eve, and they did a lot of things together, hinting at something s*xual. She also said they kissed. Plumb has denied all of this and refuses to show up anywhere McCormick is now, crushing anyone's dreams who had hopes of a Brady reunion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kathleen-turner-and-nicolas-cage><strong>Kathleen Turner And Nicolas Cage</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kathleen Turner</a> and <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> worked together on the film&nbsp;Peggy Sue Got Married. Turner has been quite vocal about her costar in the film in the past, saying that she couldn't stand him, and mocking the accent he decided to use. Still, things got much worse when, in her memoir Send Yourself Roses, Turner put a rumor that she had started in print. In the book, she claimed that Cage had been "arrested twice for drunk-driving and, I think, for stealing a dog. He'd come across a Chihuahua he liked and stuck it in his jacket." Now, Cage was furious about this rumor and took her to court for libel. He won and she apologized.</p><h2 id=bette-davis-and-joan-crawford><strong>Bette Davis And Joan Crawford</strong></h2><p>The long-lasting feud between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford is one of the best known in Hollywood. It was highly publicized when it was going on, and it’s been mythologized ever since. The battle between these two stars all began on the set of Dangerous. Both women met Franchot Tone and both fell in love with him. It was to be Crawford who stole Tone's affections, marrying the actor soon after. Davis was not thrilled. She started talking about Crawford at every occasion she could. She famously spread the rumor of Crawford, “She slept with every male star at MGM, except Lassie.” For years, Davis ensured that Crawford's reputation would never rebound. Amazingly committed to the feud, Davis even kept up her feelings after Crawford had died. When she was told about Crawford's death, Davis allegedly said, "You should never say bad things about the dead, only good. Joan Crawford is dead. Good."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: Wikipedia; IMDB; Reddit; THR</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2WsLW70axksKCfYrWiwsRmmZ6dnmLAsb7Empuippdiv7a5zquqZpmSpMK1edOhnKKqXZi8br%2FTmqmsZZakv27FxJqprGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
