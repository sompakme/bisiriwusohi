However, one of the coolest things about Elodie Grace Orkin is that Millie Bobby Brown's performance in <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>'s Stranger Things was the catalyst for her decision to pursue acting. Several years later, Brown smacks her in the face with a roller skate, every actor's dream come true! Even better would be if she made the same amount <a href=#>per episode as Millie, ($300,000.00)</a>. Keep reading to find the breakdown of Elodie Grace Orkin's net worth.</p><h2 id=elodie-grace-orkin-has-been-acting-since-a-very-young-age>Elodie Grace Orkin Has Been Acting Since A Very Young Age</h2><p>There is not yet a lot known about this blossoming actor who just recently got her big break in season 4 of Stranger Things, but we do know she has been acting since she was a young child. Nothing on the big screen, but in small theater performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also sings, as mentioned, and was featured on Jimmy Kimmel for it. In fact, the majority of the Stranger Things cast as a whole <a href=#>got their starts doing</a> the same things as Elodie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/elodie-grace-orkin-2.jpg><p>Prior to Stranger Things, she worked with Brat TV. Brat is a YouTube digital media network that launched in 2017, and features shows for young adults. Elodie was on a few episodes of Stage Fright. While it’s not clear exactly how much she made during this time period, other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shows on Brat TV pay</a> from $100.00-$150.00 a day. Elodie Grace played Kyle in 6 episodes, so at a minimum she would have been paid $600.00.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same goes for her role in Surviving Paradise as far as getting paid goes. There isn’t much information. The movie itself could probably be a success on Lifetime minus the consistent vulgarity. She plays the younger version of one of the main characters. With that, she has also done some modeling. Like most actors, you take what you can get until your big break comes in, and Elodie got hers fairly early.</p><h2 id=elodie-grace-orkin-gets-her-big-break-on-stranger-things>Elodie Grace Orkin Gets Her Big Break On Stranger Things</h2><p>In Stranger Things season 4 the character Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) appears to be leading a perfect, typical life in Lenora Hills, California. At least, this is what she is sending to Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) in her letters to him.</p><p>In actuality, Angela has been harassing El and basically making her life miserable. Angela, who is Elodie, of course, is a classic California girl. Blonde hair, beautiful, great clothes, but unfortunately also the mean girl of the 80s. She has a posse of mean girl followers too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/elodie-grace-orkin.jpg><p>Elodie was actually really <a href=#>stressed out about playing Angela</a> because she is so mean. For example, when Eleven's homework assignment is to create a diorama of her real-life hero. El picks Jim Hopper (David Harbour), a character she believes to be deceased, as her role model. Angela shouts that the task calls for real heroes, not some sheriff from a little Indiana town.</p><p>Eleven struggles to complete her presentation while in tears since the teacher is completely useless, and the entire class, particularly Angela, is making fun of her. Elodie's delivery of the lines is like using hand sanitizer and discovering that you have a paper cut. They burn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="What David Harbour's Life Was Like Before Stranger Things">What David Harbour's Life Was Like Before Stranger Things</a></span></p><p>Yet, things only get worse at the skating rink. Eleven, who is with Mike there, tells him that Angela is her best friend and that she frequently goes to parties there. When Angela learns the truth, she pushes Eleven, forcing her to skate alongside her as she and her friends surround her, and Angela pours her milkshake on her.</p><p>This sends Eleven spiraling. She can’t use her powers, so instead, she smacks her in the face with her roller skate. Thankfully they weren’t at an ice skating rink. You would never believe that Elodie is just getting started in on-screen acting with her performance here.</p><p>Now, once again, there is no confirmed amount for what Elodie made in Stranger Things, but her net worth is roughly $500,000.00. Looking at her previous work’s suspected pay, she would have had to have done like 2,000 episodes of Stage Fright vs 6 to make even a dent in half a million dollars. It is thought she made close to $100,000.00 per episode. Not bad at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-will-we-see-elodie-grace-orkin-in-next>What Will We See Elodie Grace Orkin In Next?</h2><p>After Angela took a skate to the face we don’t see Elodie again in Stranger Things, so a season 5 revival is doubtful; especially since it’s not just the fifth, but final season of the Netflix hit series. Elodie didn’t skip a beat in landing a different role, though.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Netflix Might Be Replacing Stranger Things With Wednesday, And Fans Aren't Sure What To Think">Netflix Might Be Replacing Stranger Things With Wednesday, And Fans Aren't Sure What To Think</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Burning Girls will star</a> Ruby Stokes from Bridgerton and Lockwood & Co, as well as Samantha Morton from The Walking Dead and The Serpent Queen. It will feature Elodie Grace Orkin, and a slew of other actors like Rupert Graves, Jane Lapotaire, and John Macmillian. The new series centers on a community that is troubled by its dark and stormy past and is based on CJ Tudor's best-selling 2021 novel of the same name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-20.jpg><p>The series will feature Reverend Jack Brooks, a single mother who is responsible for her husband's death and is tormented by a horror from her prior church. She relocates to Chapel Croft with her daughter Flo, a typical adolescent who follows her own path. Mother and daughter are shocked to find a town full of mysteries and conspiracies when they go to the little town in search of a new beginning. Even though a release date hasn't been officially announced, we do know that the series has recently begun production and will be streaming on Paramount+.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpaeUnrJus9Gamp5ln6e4qrqMp5ytZaekv7W0jJyfmqaXmrFurcWtnKtloKGuurXNoGSappeauaJ5zqdkrKyilruosdFmq6GhnpzAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
