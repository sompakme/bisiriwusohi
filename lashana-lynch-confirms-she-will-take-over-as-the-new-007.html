"I just have to remind myself that the conversation is happening and that I’m a part of something that will be very, very revolutionary.</p><p>"I feel very grateful that I get to challenge those narratives. We’re moving away from toxic masculinity, and that’s happening because women are being open, demanding and vocal, and calling out misbehavior as soon as we see it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No Time To Die was delayed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is now penciled in for an April 2021 release. Lynch's appearance as Nomi in the latest trailer depicts an agent equal to Bond in skill and wit. There are also hints of Bond being betrayed by someone close, who could turn out to be Nomi - although the traitor is really thought to be either Madeline Swann or Paloma.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Daniel Craig's Bike Stunt In No Time To Die Used Up $70K Just For Coca-Cola" href=#>Daniel Craig's Bike Stunt In No Time To Die Used Up $70K Just For Coca-Cola</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper's Bazaar</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8uaqqGZnpZ6rcXNnJ9mm5%2Bjs6q%2BzGZnaW9dp7ytsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
