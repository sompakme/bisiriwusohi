McIntyre says he targeted Punk in the Royal Rumble, and he slept like a baby after hearing he took out Punk. Now, he’s going to live CM Punk’s dream… again.</p><h2>A most compelling character</h2><p>In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ReviewSTL</a>, Drew McIntyre discussed his current character. He described how he feels this is the most compelling he has felt as a character in a long time.</p><p>“100%. I always kind of compete with myself. I don’t really compete with anyone else on the roster. It’s just, I’ll never be number one because I’m always competing with myself. Looking across the board, WWE in general, but specifically on Raw, everybody is upping their game. Be it on the microphone, be it from a character perspective. Be it from the in-ring game. It’s awesome to see because it’s a three-hour show and it’s not easy to sit down and watch a three-hour wrestling show. It’s like watching a three-hour film, no matter how good it is, a Martin Scorcese number. ‘Wow, that was really good, but it was long.’</p><p>“These days, we have so many different characters, unique storytelling going on. For me, personally, this is the most compelling character-wise I’ve felt in a very long time because of the different approach we’re taking telling stories, which is to make it as real as possible because if it’s real to the superstar, they’re feeling it and the audience will be with them.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNtZ29vY2Kxs7HWZqScoZ6pxrOxjKucmpukqHq1u4ykoKWkmaO0bq%2FMZqeuppuoeri%2BxKyrpZ2dlruqrYymmKKmXZrDprrTZpurnZGi</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
