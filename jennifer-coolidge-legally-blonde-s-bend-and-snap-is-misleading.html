Jennifer Coolidge broke down whether Legally Blonde’s iconic “bend and snap” move has ever worked for her — and which movie line is the most quoted.
The 60-year-old actress confessed that the 2001 scene is a “moment in moviemaking I would just totally disagree with,” telling Deadline she hasn’t had luck with the pick-up technique.
“I’ve never had bending over work for me like it did in that movie,” Coolidge told the outlet in an interview published on Saturday, August 13."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In the first film, her character is told by Elle Woods (<a href=#><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>) to do the <a href=#>“bend and snap” move</a> to land the delivery man that she has been swooning over for months.</p><p>Coolidge, however, isn’t convinced that bending over and quickly picking up a pen while pushing up your breasts is a fool-proof pick-up tool. She did note on Saturday that it could work with one wardrobe change.</p><p>“I’d have to say when I did do the ‘bend and snap,’ I was wearing my underwear and I feel like in real life you have to leave it off,” she added.</p><p>The <a href=#>White Lotus</a> star explained that while the “bend and snap” is memorable, it’s <a href=#>nowhere near the most quoted line</a> from the two films.</p><p>“It’s so weird because there’s something about the Fourth of July line from Legally Blonde 2. I get so many DMs and texts and people leaving things in my mailbox,” she confessed. “And if I’m out on that day, people just go nuts.”</p><p>The <a href=#>American Pie actress</a> is referring to the line where Paulette says, “You look like the Fourth of July. That makes me want a hot dog real bad.”</p><p>News broke in 2020 that <a href=#>Legally Blonde 3</a> was given the green light and Witherspoon, 46, is set to return. <a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a> and <strong>Dan Goor</strong> were later announced as writers for the new script and the Sweet Home Alabama star’s production company, Hello Sunshine, is on board to work on the project.</p><p>While there have since been delays in production — Kaling, 43, confirmed in November 2021 that the script was still being worked on — Coolidge is ready to reprise her role.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I did hear at one point after <a href=#>The Morning Show</a> [that] it’s going [to happen],” the A Cinderella Story actress <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in January 2020 of the new film. “But of course, there’s rumors that you read every day in the newspaper that say, ‘Legally Blonde is opening May 20 this year,’ and you’re, like, ‘Well, ugh.’ But I don’t know. I would love to play Paulette again.”</p><p>Witherspoon, for her part, confirmed in December 2021 that fans can expect the return of Paulette as Elle’s sidekick. “It’s a lot of me and this lady [Coolidge], that’s all I have to say,” she teased to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight </a>at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGepp6es6a%2BjJymqKSZmbSmecuenpqknK56o7jOp5ueq12Xsq%2BwjJqlnWWjo66xecisZKaho6GyorDIp55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
