With both <strong>G&R </strong>and other ventures providing each respective member with a handsome net worth, this list wishes to shed light on exactly who has been the most fortunate over the years.</p><h2 id=melissa-reese-2-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Melissa Reese: $2 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><a href=#><strong>Melissa Reese</strong> became the first female member of <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong> (and the current youngest) back in 2016</a>. Along with Guns N’ Roses, Reese has worked with the likes <strong>of Buckethead</strong>, <strong>Brian Mantia</strong> (in Brian and Melissa) and composed part of the soundtrack for the video game Infamous, as well as other video game-related musical work. The 31-year-old keyboardist has amassed a net worth of <strong>$2 million </strong>thanks to her musical endeavors. The Seattle native dreams big and now has the bank account to match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-fortus-3-5-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Richard Fortus: $3.5 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Richard Fortus</strong> holds the honorable distinction of being one of the longest-tenured members of <strong>G&R</strong> (besides <strong>Axl</strong> and <strong>Dizzy Reed</strong>.) Fortus has played in such bands as, Love Spit Love, Thin Lizzy, and The Dead Daisies and, along the way, has managed to generate a net worth of <strong>$3.5 million. </strong>Ripping on the guitar for “Guns” since 2002, Fortus will almost certainly see his net worth grow before he’s ready to hang up his guitar and ride off into the sunset.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Amber Rose Named Her Son, Slash Electric</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gilby-clarke-5-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Gilby Clarke: $5 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>The former rhythm guitarist (rather short term at that) was tasked with replacing beloved longtime rhythm man <strong>Izzy Stradlin</strong> back in 1991. After the collapse of the original Guns N’ Roses,<strong> Clarke</strong> went on to find success with a solo career, playing alongside Slash in Slash’s SnakePit and most notably, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being part of<strong> Rockstar Supernova</strong></a>. Throughout his travels through the world of music, Clarke has amassed a comfortable net worth of<strong> $5 million. </strong>Clarke did join the band (consisting of Slash, Adler, McKagan and Sorum) in a reunion performance for their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2012.</p><h2 id=matt-sorum-10-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Matt Sorum: $10 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The former drummer of Guns N’ Roses (before the early 90s implosion), <strong>Sorum </strong>replaced <strong>Steven Adler</strong> in 1990. Performing drumming duties for Guns N’ Roses and eventually Velvet Revolver, Sorum has generated a handsome net worth of<strong> $10 million. </strong>Currently touring with supergroup<strong> Kings of Chaos</strong>, Matt continues to wail away on the “skins” when he's not spending his accumulated wealth. <strong></strong></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg And Guns N' Roses To Share Stage In Pre-Super Bowl Pairing</a></span></p><h2 id=steven-adler-15-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Steven Adler: $15 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Steven Adler </strong>was the original drummer for <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong>. Part of the band’s debut album, Appetite For Destruction, Adler would sadly see his days with the band come to an end due to a grueling battle with addiction. Being a member of one of the world’s most renowned brands and the biggest band of your era will surely net you a handsome chunk of change. Indeed, the drummer has earned a whopping<strong> $15 million</strong> for himself over the years. After a few appearances on reality TV and a collaboration with former G&R bandmate Slash on his solo album, Adler would be inducted, along with the other “Guns” members, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><h2 id=izzy-stradlin-28-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Izzy Stradlin: $28 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another original <strong>G&R</strong> member and co-founder of said band, <strong>Izzy Stradlin </strong>was a childhood friend of <strong>Axl Rose</strong> back in Indiana. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After attaining sobriety in the early 90s, Stradlin left the band, finding the applications and tension within the band intolerable</a>. However, the former rhythm guitarist isn't short on cash as he has amassed a net worth of <strong>$28 million</strong> with his work in G&R as well as other ventures such as playing with the Ju Ju Hounds, a solo run and a brief reunion G&R (he also contributed to some songwriting on Velvet Revolver’s debut album.)</p><h2 id=frank-ferrer-32-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Frank Ferrer: $32 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Ferrer</strong> began banging the drums for <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong> back in 2006. The Brooklyn native has contributed to the Chinese Democracy album and is the current drummer for the band. In his career, he has played with the band The Beautiful, Psychedelic Furs (with fellow G&R bandmate <strong>Richard Fortus</strong>), Love Spit Love, among others. The mammoth drummer is no stranger to wealth, having made a cool $<strong>32 million</strong> over the years thanks to his musical prowess.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dizzy-reed-40-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Dizzy Reed: $40 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>The original <strong>G&R</strong> guitarist, <strong>Dizzy,</strong> joined the band back in 1990, though his relationship with the band goes all the way back to 1985. Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with his G&R bandmates in 2012, but was not present for the ceremony. Reed is one of the longest-tenured members of the band and, for his trouble, has amassed a net worth of <strong>$40 million. </strong>Not too shabby.</p><h2 id=duff-mckagan-80-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Duff McKagan: $80 Million Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A founding member of both <strong>Gun N’ Roses</strong> and Velvet Revolver, <strong>Duff</strong> has been bringing up the bottom end for well over 30 years. Ripping and grooving on the bass has allowed him to amass quite the hefty sum of <strong>$80 million</strong>. With several albums under his belt and a storied career in music,<strong> McKagan</strong> has the massive wealth worth of a legendary musician.</p><h2 id=slash-100-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Slash: $100 million Net Worth</span></h2><p><strong>Slash</strong> is one of the biggest icons in rock music. After all,<a href=#> if you can make a guy like Jason Mamoa nervous when hanging out with him</a> and <a href=#>Amber Rose decides to name her child after you</a>, you're a pretty big deal, right? Slash has been tearing it up on stage since the mid-80s and has generated a fortune for himself as well as his family while doing it. The<strong> G&R</strong> and Velvet Revolver guitarist has piloted his own solo outings, as well as lent his skills to other artists’ albums. What does he have to show for it? <strong>$100 million</strong> net worth. Keep on rockin’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=axl-rose-230-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Axl Rose: $230 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>When making a list of the best rock front people of all time, <strong>W. Axl Rose</strong> would definitely be at the top of the list. The singer has been the quintessential leader of <strong>Guns N’ Roses</strong> (every iteration) for many years and had fans rejoicing when the band finally reunited (<a href=#>Even setting Twitter ablaze with their huge, live music comeback at Fenway Park.</a>) Being one of the icons of rock has made Rose a wealthy man, amassing a net worth of <strong>$230 million. </strong>With that kind of money, Rose can hire somebody else to hold a candle in that cold November rain… (sorry.)</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Slash's Son And Other Rockstar Children Have Formed The Band Suspect208</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGierqajYrtuvs6snKxlka25br7OrJxmq5yWwKl5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpedGimqGdo6l6s7HUp6Copl2YvK6xwZqapGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
