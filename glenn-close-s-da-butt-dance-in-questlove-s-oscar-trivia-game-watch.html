The rules? A song from a movie gets played and then a participant has to figure out if the song won an Oscar, was nominated for one or neither.</p><p>To kick things off, Howery picked singer and actress <a href=# id=auto-tag_andra-day data-tag=andra-day>Andra Day</a>. After Prince’s 1984 chart-climbing track, “Purple Rain”, was played and the two of them sang along, Day frankly answered with “I mean it’s a brilliant song. It probably wasn’t even nominated, and that’s some bullsh*t.” Although her candid response was censored in the American live broadcast, her uncensored answer was audible on international television networks. Nonetheless, she answered correctly.</p><p>“It is, right, because it wasn’t nominated actually,” said Lil Rel. “Nah, the [movie’s] score won the award, but none of the songs from the score got nominated. Ain’t that crazy?” Andra responded saying, “That sounds about right. Here” before handing the microphone back to Howery.</p><p>After joking about not knowing how much ABC was going to get fined for Day’s bluntness, he moved on to the newly Oscar-winning star <a href=# id=auto-tag_daniel-kaluuya data-tag=daniel-kaluuya>Daniel Kaluuya</a>. They joked about how Lil Rel is always having to save Kaluuya from “The Sunken Place” before the actor incorrectly answered the trivia question about Donna Summer’s 1978 Best Original Song-winning single, “Last Dance.”</p><p>But the random (and maybe scripted?) moment of the night happened when Howery moved on to veteran actress Glenn Close. Questlove cued up “Da Butt,” the 1988 song by Go-Go band, Experience Unlimited. As the comedian started expressing his doubt of Close knowing the track, the eight-time Oscar nominee pumped the brakes and recalled what she knew about the cultural jam.</p><p>“No, wait a second! That’s ‘Da Butt!'” the 74-year-old Greenwich, CT native said. “It was a classic song by the great Washington D.C. go-go band E.U. Yeah, shoutout to Sugar Bear and the Backyard Band and the whole D.M.V…so anyway, wait, I remember this. Spike Lee had it written for his brilliant movie School Daze. My friends at the Oscars missed it and it wasn’t nominated so it couldn’t have won which I think is a [censored]. So that’s it.”</p><p>Before we knew it, Lil Rel challenged her to do the actual dance on live television…and she did. Yeah, super random, but it served its purpose and gave viewers a nice break from the drag of lengthy award shows. Nonetheless, thanks for the laugh, <a href=# id=auto-tag_jesse-collins data-tag=jesse-collins>Jesse Collins</a> Entertainment, and the production crew behind this year’s Oscars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5y5prrNZpqlp6OaeqWtjJusraxdma6vr8RmqK6do6m5sMLEZqasm5GnerW%2ByK%2BgmmWXlrqmeZBram1uYW5%2BeIOO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
