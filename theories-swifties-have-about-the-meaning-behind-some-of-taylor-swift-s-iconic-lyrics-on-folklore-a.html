And with her having nine studio albums, Swifties have a lot of cases to open. Here are the theories fans have about the meaning behind her beautiful melodies on her two most recent albums, folklore and evermore.</p><h2 id=39-cardigan-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'Cardigan'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a soft melody and a beautiful music video, it’s no wonder why fans loved this song when it first came out. But many believe that this song is actually about the fans. The lyrics “when I felt like I was an old cardigan, under someone's bed. You put me on and said I was your favorite” refer to how her fans stood by her even when the press tried to demonize her. This suggests that the cardigan is a metaphor for her and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this song is really just a love letter to her fans.</a></p><h2 id=39-my-tears-ricochet-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'My Tears Ricochet'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This slow bop may seem like a sad breakup song but it is definitely much more than that. Many Swifties think that this song is actually about her split from Big Machine Records. The lyrics “I didn’t have it in myself to go with grace” could refer to the fact that she wouldn’t just let her old masters go, as she fought to be able to own her own songs. Lyrics like “you wear the same jewels that I gave you as you bury me” could be that they’re still profiting off her first six albums while they turn against her. She even references them in the song as “stolen lullabies”. And let’s not forget the lyrics “And I can go anywhere I want, anywhere I want, just not home” nods to the fact that she can move forward anywhere within the music industry but not own her masters. It’s safe to say, this song is giving another finger to her old record label.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Songs Taylor Swift Has Written About Her Boyfriend Joe Alwyn</a></span></p><h2 id=39-gold-rush-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>'Gold Rush'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now while many fans have speculated over which boy this Swift song could be about, many think the answer is easier than you think. First off, Swift describes the boy in the song to be surrounded by women who adore him, which led many to point a finger at Harry Styles (but to be fair, this reference could be towards any of her famous ex’s). <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Many connected the use of gold in her song, with the track released by Styles called 'Golden</a>'. There is even a line in the song that makes a nod towards an Eagles t-shirt, which Styles was coincidentally photographed with around the same time. This is enough for fans to be convinced, that this song is about former One Direction member Harry Styles and there is no changing their mind.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Fans Confused As Singer Releases '1989' Track Despite 'Red' Re-Recording Being Her Next Album</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-coney-island-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Coney Island'</span></h2><p>Swifties have suggested that this song is a throwback to all of Taylor's older songs (and in turn, about her old ex’s). Many of the lyrics mirror older songs that are said to be about different relationships. The lyrics “did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?” is a reference to her song 'Dear John', in which she says “you paint me a blue sky. Then go back and turn it to rain” which is about her then-boyfriend John Mayer. The lyrics “standing in the hallway, with a big cake” mirrors a line in 'The Moment I Knew', rumored to be about Jake Gyllenhaal. In the song, she also references an accident which parallels the accident mentioned in 'Out of the Woods' (said to be about iconic ex Harry Styles). There are also lines that could be potential nods to Taylor Lautner, Joe Jonas, or Tom Hiddelston. Whether this is true or not is open to interpretation but if it is, you best believe that this bop spills all the tea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-invisible-string-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'Invisible String'</span></h2><p>Now this theory is not about the entire song itself but a shoutout hidden within the lyrics. The song, 'Invisible String', is about Taylor Swift’s current relationship with Joe Alywn and how they were destined to be together. In this beautiful melody about the future, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift also references the past and how it led her here</a>. The nod to her ex of the same first name happens in the third verse, with her stating “for all the boys who broke my heart, now I send their babies presents”. Despite not explicitly stating it was about her quick relationship with Jonas Brothers member Joe Jonas, Joe Jonas and his Game of Thrones-star wife, Sophie Turner, welcomed their first child around the same time. And if the timeline fits, then it has to be true, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-epiphany-39><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>'Epiphany'</span></h2><p>Taylor Swift has always been influenced by those around her when it comes to how she lives her life and music. So when 'Marjorie' was released, there was no need for speculation as Swift told the world that this song was influenced by her grandmother (even crediting her in the background vocals of the track). Many Swifties looked back to her folklore album to notice that her song 'Epiphany', which was acknowledged as a sort of tribute to frontline workers in the midst of a global pandemic, also had nods to her grandfather. This theory was quickly confirmed by Swift as the song was written from her grandfather Dean Swift’s perspective as a World War II Veteran.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Joe Alwyn Have The Lowest Net Worth Of All Taylor Swift's Boyfriends?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2fp7amv4ysrqKepJ6ytHnHmq2eZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa2qZqGTpLuqr4ylsKuhk6h6p7vLpKOoqpVisrex0aamq51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
