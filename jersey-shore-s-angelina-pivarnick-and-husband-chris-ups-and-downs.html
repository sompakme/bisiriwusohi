Unlike <a href=#><strong>Pauly D</strong></a> and <strong>Nikki Hall</strong>, it didn’t really help our relationship out too much. It kind of did the opposite,” she exclusively told Us in June 2021.</p><p>During the season, Angelina explained how one fight between her and her husband led to him moving out.</p><p>“We got into a fight and he moved in with his mother, and it’s been a few weeks now,” she explained in a June 2021 episode of Jersey Show: Family Vacation.</p><p>She continued: “Chris leaving and taking down his stocking, ripping up ‘Merry Christmas to my wife’ card, he wanted me to see that card ripped up. Chris wanted me to see that stocking gone. Chris wanted me to see all his clothing gone. For him to do that to me over a fricken fight, it’s just not fair, you know?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Angelina filed for divorce in January 2021, Us confirmed that September that their divorce case was dismissed nearly two months prior.</p><p>Scroll through for a timeline of their ups and downs:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a%2B0p6wZquYpL%2Bmv4yapaCdnJ67onnPoq2aqp6esKx5wKebZqClqK%2BiusNmmqGqmah6trzSZpinnF2ZvLi60mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
