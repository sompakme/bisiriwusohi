Coltrane was born in Rutherglen, Scotland, on March 30, 1950. Coltrane grew up in Rutherglen, Scotland, with his older sister, Jane.</p><p>Coltrane was the great-grandson of Scottish businessman Thomas W. Howie and the nephew of Forbes Howie, who was also a famous businessman. Coltrane admitted in an interview that he had a wild streak back in his teen years as Coltrane was known to defy conventional norms and participate in activist groups even as a young student when he pushed for the abolition of private education.</p><p>In his early twenties, Coltrane changed careers and began performing on stage and in comedic roles under Coltrane's moniker. Before jumping to feature films, he made his acting debut in John Byrne's The Slab Boys at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre in 1978. Coltrane quickly transitioned to the silver screen, appearing in films like Flash Gordon. He has also portrayed Samuel Johnson on television in the Blackadder series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the 1990s, he reprised his role as forensic psychologist Dr. Edward 'Fitz' Fitzgerald in the TV series Cracker, for which he received three BAFTA awards, including one for best actor.

From 2001 through 2011, he was in all eight movies. J.</p><p>After being asked who she would want to play Hagrid, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling said Robbie Coltrane for Hagrid. On paper, Hagrid was a bumbling, amusing, and steadfast friend to Harry and his companions, his outer look and fondness for terrible magical creatures belying a soft center.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a> claims that Coltrane gave Hagrid a genuine quality that made him stand out in a crowd during a decade's worth of films.

Coltrane reunited with the rest of the Harry Potter cast in 2021 for HBO Max's Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts, which celebrated how young people all over the world fell in love with author J.K. Rowling's stories.</p><h2 id=the-final-years-of-coltrane>The Final Years Of Coltrane</h2><p>Osteoarthritis was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debilitating condition for Coltrane</a> in his final years.
