Take a look at these advices which can help you accelerate your career and success</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Extravagant Billionaire: A Peek Inside The $20 Billion Empire Of The Rainbow Sheikh" href=#>The Extravagant Billionaire: A Peek Inside The $20 Billion Empire Of The Rainbow Sheikh</a></span></p><h2 id=invest-in-your-abilities>Invest In Your Abilities</h2><p>Warren Buffet once said that the best investment anyone can make is investing in your own abilities. Invest in anything that will help develop your own abilities and skills that will eventually be helpful to your business. It is better to treat one’s career as a business and your own self as the main product. You cannot win your dream job if you are not willing to invest in yourself. Be creative and think of something that will make yourself more marketable and only allot five hours a week into it. May it be taking classes, obtaining certification, attending seminars or learning a new useful language. Anything that can help you become better to be closer to your dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=let-other-people-handle-mundane-tasks>Let Other People Handle Mundane Tasks</h2><p>The<a href=#> CEO of Hewlett Packard Meg Whitman</a> whose current net worth is $3 billion, has said that through the years, she is always on the hunt for the right person to solve a problem and she does not have all the time in the world. She is currently the supreme leader who is steering the company as the captain of the ship. Although she knows how to lead, she also knows how to delegate tasks. Handing out a project that she knows will take up much of her plate can help her devote more time in improving the company. It is better to delegate tasks that do not require ultimate focus and strength to others. Tapping into the team or co-worker’s strength will become essential part of the company’s success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=take-risks-and-leave-your-comfort-zone>Take Risks And Leave Your Comfort Zone</h2><p>Steve Jobs said that innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower. Going up to the corporate ranks or even starting a multimillion dollar business is something that does not happen to people who stay in their comfort zone and enjoy the comfort with the status quo. Leaders constantly think of different ways to make their situations better and are not afraid to take risks and go against the norm and leave the comfort zone. It is great to scare oneself to take a step towards improvement and leaving the comfort zone. It will not work every time but it is much better to fail than to never have tried at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=failure-is-part-of-the-process>Failure Is Part Of The Process</h2><p>Oprah Winfrey said that failure is just another steppingstone leading to greatness. Research suggests that about 80 to 90% of the startups worldwide have encountered failure on their first venture. Unfortunately, most of these startups give up on their first failure not knowing that success is much sweeter after a failure. Media mogul Oprah Winfrey with a net worth of $3.1 billion started with nothing and failed numerous times but it did not hinder her from becoming successful. Failure can always lead to success as long as you do not stop.</p><h2 id=attention-to-detail-is-crucial>Attention To Detail Is Crucial</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Chinese billionaire Zhou Qunfei whose net worth is $5.7 billion, her father had lost his eyesight and so if they placed something for her father to use, it had to be on the exact spot or else something could go wrong. This kind of attentiveness to detail has led the Chinese billionaire to success. Committing to near perfections seems difficult and harsh but sometimes it is the thin line between standing on the way between your dream and it becoming a reality. Zhou Qunfei is currently <a href=#>the richest self made woman</a> across the world and that happened for a reason. She works hard and demands nothing but the ultimate best from her team. She has an inspiring story as she started as a factory worker from a province in China and now recognized across the world. Always pay attention and be on the lookout for the areas that could use some improvement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-biggest-risk-is-not-taking-a-risk-at-all>The Biggest Risk Is Not Taking A Risk At All</h2><p>Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg once said that the biggest risk is actually not taking any risk at all. He added that in our world where things constantly change, the only failure that is guaranteed to happen is not taking any risk at all. If it weren’t for Zuckerberg taking risks with his colleagues back then, the world would not have Facebook. Back then, it was almost impossible and seemed farfetched but the group made it work. Always push your ideas and believe in yourself to take risks and embrace your failures.</p><h2 id=believe-in-changing-the-world>Believe In Changing The World</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Former CEO of Google Larry Page</a> believe that if one believes that you will be changing the world and they’re working on important things, getting up in the morning will be more exciting. Google would have not existed today if not for the founders who believed that they would be changing the world someday. Google is known in our world today giving the faster and more convenient access to information. It would be hard today to imagine a world without Google which has been a massive help to everyone in our world today. Find that positivity in your life and things would be a little more different and would make a massive impact in your daily life.</p><h2 id=being-kind-goes-a-long-way>Being Kind Goes A Long Way</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>American billionaire entrepreneur, television personality, and media proprietor Mark Cuban believes that committing random acts of kindness will go a long way. Sure you can earn your success, however you can never do it alone. There will be a handful of people who will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">help you build a pyramid </a>and eventually reach the top and being kind to these people will not hurt you. Learn to give back and be generous as generosity always comes back.</p><h2 id=be-stubborn-but-flexible>Be Stubborn, But Flexible</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos whose net worth is $131.9 billion, believes that it is possible to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">be stubborn and flexible</a> at the same time. Be stubborn in pursuing your goals but be much more flexible in how you go about it. This has helped the <a href=#>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos</a> succeed in his endeavors. He added that if you are not stubborn enough, you will eventually give up on your ventures too soon and if you are not flexible, you will pound your head against the wall numerous times if something does not go your way.</p><h2 id=be-ready-to-work-day-and-night-to-achieve-your-goal>Be Ready To Work Day And Night To Achieve Your Goal</h2><p>Before starting a business, American businesswoman Diane Hendricks believes that it is better to make sure you are 100% committed to your goal. She added that it will take a lot of hard work to reach your goal and it will never be easy but it is worth it. Before you start you journey, make sure that you are committed to it so and never give up along the way. Accept the fact that you will have to adjust along the way since your path will never be the same as how you envisioned it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="These Are The Highly Effective Habits Of Most Billionaires" href=#>These Are The Highly Effective Habits Of Most Billionaires</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On The Dot Woman</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6ClpJmku6K10Z6qZpufmbJuwMeeqp5lo5q5p3nMmpueZZKeua21zqeYoqqVqHqzsdWemKVlpJ2yqr6MpqasrF2eurG70a2Yp6xdqLKkvsStqmasn2LAtq%2FCnpydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
