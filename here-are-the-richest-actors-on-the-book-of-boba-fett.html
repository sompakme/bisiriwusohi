Thanks to The Mandalorian, everyone's favorite bounty hunter was given a second chance after seemingly getting killed off at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. Due to the cult-like love of the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy, The Book of Boba Fett is set to become as successful as The Mandalorian. That means the cast members all get to breathe a sigh of relief... their bank accounts will likely never dry up. Here are the richest cast members of the Book of Boba Fett...</p><h2 id=daniel-logan-is-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Daniel Logan Is Worth $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Daniel Logan has made a decent living playing the younger version of Boba Fett in Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones, The Book of Boba Fett, and The Clone Wars.
