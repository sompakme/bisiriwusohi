Ripa quickly gained popularity within the entertainment world and landed a multitude of roles in the industry, including her lead on Hope & Faith and of course, her spot beside Regis Philbin on Live With Regis & Kelly.</p><p>After accepting the role back in 2001, Kelly has remained as the lead host on the hit talk show series, which has seen many co-hosts, from Michael Strahan to Ryan Seacrest.</p><p>Kelly claims&nbsp;that regardless of what role she would have had under the spotlight, being a "polarizing figure" is inevitable, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she isn't into being one at all!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve been saying that it’s time to fold ‘em for 20 years,” Kelly shared with Bethenny Frankel on her podcast, Just B. "For 20 years I’ve been saying, ‘I can’t do it anymore. I can’t do it. I’m too old for this crap. I need to find another career. I need to get off camera.’ I’ve been saying that forever."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Ripa's Beauty Routine Explained</a></span></p><p>While Kelly Ripa has certainly done well for herself in the business, amassing a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth of $120 million,</a> which doesn't include her husband, Mark Cnseulos' fortune either, she still wishes she didn't have to always be in front of the camera!</p><p>When it comes to being on camera, Kelly hasn't enjoyed this part of her job as much, considering she's, "Not very comfortable. I always say I could do my job for 200 years if it didn’t happen on camera.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bethenny Frankel went on to ask if any of that had to do with the critique and criticism of her looks and whether that's made her "self-conscious".</p><p>"All of that!" Ripa quickly replied.&nbsp;“I don’t like the attention, I don’t go to parties, I don’t go to Hollywood events. I don’t do any of that stuff. I would rather buy clothes than have to ask to borrow anything. It’s painful.”</p><p>Luckily for the star, there was one upside to being under the limelight for so long!</p><p>During her reign on All My Children, Kelly met Mark Consuelos, whom she would go on to marry in 1996. The couple has remained happily together since, expanding their family with three kids, Lola, Michael, and Joaquin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kelly went on to discuss how family is the most important thing to her, and how she always wanted to "raise my kids," she said. I didn’t want to have them and never get to see them."</p><p>While she's managed to find a happy medium, Kelly Ripa's 30+ year career has definitely served her right, however, could this possibly be the beginning of the end?</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kelly Ripa Looks Unrecognizable Without Makeup On</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoLKtuNhmqaKokWLEqr%2FHnqpmq5iaeqmtw2aYZpyZm7OmvsSnq2abkaeypr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
