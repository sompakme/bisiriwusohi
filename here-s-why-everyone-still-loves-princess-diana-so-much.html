The idea of Diana's&nbsp;refined and much celebrated&nbsp;image no longer gracing the world was almost impossible to fathom. As then Prime Minister Tony Blair said at the time of her shocking death in 1997, Diana was "the people's princess." The young mom was beloved by the British public, even when she decided to leave the Royal Family behind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Piers Morgan Leads Disappointed Fans Slamming New Princess Diana&nbsp;Statue</a></span></p><p>Last week, Princess Diana would have turned 60-years-old and the occasion was celebrated with the erection of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statue in her honor</a>. This is testament to just how loved the departed royal is to this day. Here's why everyone still loves Princes Diana so much.</p><h2 id=she-was-a-champion-of-lgbt-rights><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Was A Champion&nbsp;Of LGBT Rights</span></h2><p>It may now be the norm for celebs to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">come out as LGBT+</a>, but things were very different in the '90s. At a time when homophobia was rife and LGBT people were routinely discriminated against, the community had a friend in Princess Diana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In contrast to&nbsp;the seemingly stuffy and insular Royal Family members, Diana supported the gay community. She showed endless support&nbsp;for gay people, with close friends such as Elton John and Freddie Mercury, who once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">snuck the princess into a gay club</a>.</p><h2 id=her-aids-activism-was-pioneering><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her AIDS&nbsp;Activism&nbsp;Was Pioneering</span></h2><p>It may seem as though Covid-19 is the&nbsp;most destructive&nbsp;pandemic in recent history, but a far deadlier virus ravaged the world in the '80s and '90s. The virus was, of course, HIV. At the time, there was a plethora of misinformation being spread about the transmission of HIV, with many believing that merely being in the presence of an&nbsp;afflicted&nbsp;person could lead to being infected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But Princess Diana did all that she could to debunk these myths. A passionate <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">advocate of combatting HIV/AIDS stigma</a>, the princess often met with AIDS patients in hospital and, most importantly, she kissed them and shook their hands to emphasize&nbsp;that the virus was not transmissible through being in close proximity with a sufferer.</p><h2 id=her-chic-style-is-still-considered-iconic><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Her Chic Style Is Still Considered Iconic</span></h2><p>With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Crown</a> bringing in millions of viewers and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Diana biopic</a> in the works, we are reminded of the timeless style of the late princess. Fans simply adored Diana's classy and effortless outfits, with some critics arguing that her chic elegance still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hasn't been matched by contemporary royals</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-reminds-people-of-a-simpler-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Reminds People Of A Simpler Time</span></h2><p>Nostalgia is an inevitable component of any cultural climate, but with the horrors and uncertainty that this Covid era has brought us, a longing for the past lingers like never before. The public still loves Princess Diana because she reminds us of a simpler time, one before technology controlled every facet of our lives, and one in which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Prince Harry</a> and Prince William were united, as opposed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">constantly clashing</a>.</p><h2 id=fans-know-she-would-have-loved-being-a-grandmother><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Fans Know She Would Have Loved Being A Grandmother</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Royal fans were in tears when the grandchildren&nbsp;Princes Diana never met <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">paid tribute to her</a> earlier this year. Prince William's children, Charlotte, George and Louis, pay tribute to Diana every year on Mother's Day by making sweet cards for her. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shared a photo of the poignant card the royal kids made for their late grandmother this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The World Reacts To Prince Harry And Prince Williams' Reunion</a></span></p><p>"Princess Diana is looking down and full of pride. She was a phenomenal woman and mother," commented one&nbsp;Diana fan on Instagram.</p><h2 id=she-modernized-the-royal-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Modernized The Royal Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Royal Family is generally seen as an antiquated, albeit popular, institution. Various strict codes of conduct contribute to this stuffy image. But when Princess Diana joined the&nbsp; Royal Family following her 1981 marriage to Prince Charles, she helped modernize the esteemed institution.&nbsp;For instance, she&nbsp;loved rock music and took Prince Charles to a concert by British rockers Status Quo in 1982.</p><h2 id=fans-think-the-royal-family-didn-t-treat-her-well><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fans Think The Royal Family Didn't Treat Her Well</span></h2><p>Part of Diana's enduring appeal is the image of her as the victim of a scornful and unwelcoming family. The princess herself opened up about her "brutal" treatment at the hands of the Royals, describing herself as "a product sitting on a shelf" in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial BBC interview</a> with Martin Bashir.</p><p>Being rejected by one's in-laws is a scenario that countless&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;can identify with, hence Diana's unwavering popularity among the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-public-wants-to-know-the-truth-about-her-death><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Public Wants To Know The Truth About Her Death</span></h2><p>When Diana tragically died in Paris in 1997, it wasn't long before various conspiracy theories emerged. To this day, fans want to know exactly what happened to the princess, with outlandish theories still rife.</p><p>Although it is generally accepted that Diana died in a car crash as the result of being hounded by the paparazzi, who still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photographed her body</a> as she lay among the wreckage, many members of the public still believe her death is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shrouded in mystery</a>.</p><h2 id=an-anti-racist-fans-think-she-would-have-supported-meghan-markle><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>An Anti-Racist, Fans Think She Would Have Supported Meghan Markle</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this year, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry claimed in their Oprah interview that a member of the Royal Family made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">racist remarks</a> about baby Archie's skin tone.&nbsp;The allegations&nbsp;highlighted the racism prevalent in the institution, with many believing that this bigotry led to Harry and Meghan's decision to leave.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprising Facts About Meghan Markle's Life Before 'Suits'</a></span></p><p>But Princess Diana was one royal who was never racist. After splitting with Prince Charles, Diana <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated a number of men</a>, including men of color. At the time of her death, her boyfriend was Egyptian film producer Dodi Fayed, who died by her side in the car crash. She also dated British-Pakistani surgeon Hasnat Ahmad Khan. Accordingly, Diana's butler, Paul Burrell, says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she would have loved Meghan</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dead-celebs-are-often-lionized><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dead Celebs Are Often Lionized</span></h2><p>Sadly, it is often the case that celebrities are worshipped and venerated once they pass away. It's pretty common for celebs to be treated like saints when they die and there is perhaps no dead celebrity who has been lionized more than Princess Diana.</p><p>Would Di have been&nbsp;revered&nbsp;had she lived? Certainly. But there is no denying that her untimely death, and its tragic nature, is one of the reasons why everyone still loves her so much.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Can Meghan Markle And Prince Harry's Daughter Live A Normal Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnK%2Bdoq68r7GMrKuipJxiubDCxKxkqaqZo7Cmv9Jmm6KZnpZ6tLuMpqycoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
