We’re just gonna stay really hopeful. I guess the biggest thing is we hope the baby stays inside and can get as big as possible before this big event they have to go through.

I’m grateful for doctors and nurses and will do whatever they suggest we do.”</p><p>Days prior to her hospitalization, Perri shared nude maternity photos with her Instagram followers. “I don’t know if I’ll ever be pregnant again, so this time I’m going to celebrate and honor my pregnancy, my baby and my beautiful body,” she wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602aaoaqZqMGqusBmp56qop7Abq7Am7Bmr5mhuW66xJ6bZqulp7SmvthmmJ%2Bslad6o7XRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
