Now, Warner Bros. is reportedly waiting to see how the pandemic evolves before deciding on a release date for Tenet.</p><p>Originally scheduled for release on July 17, Tenet&nbsp;was pushed back to July 31 and then August 12. Given the recent spikes of COVID-19 cases in Florida and Texas, the film debut was indefinitely delayed. Disney also decided to cancel Mulan’s scheduled August 21 premiere.</p><p>Warner Bros. Chairman Toby Emmerich confirmed that the release of Tenet would not be global, though some are concerned that by showing the film in different markets at different times, the spy thriller’s surprises might&nbsp;be compromised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, foreign markets have been clamoring for the release of Tenet and Mulan since exhibitors are experiencing record losses as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. Jocelyn Bouyssy, managing director of CGR Cinemas, France’s second-biggest theater chain, said the further delay of Tenet and Mulan would be a catastrophe since cinemas are already struggling to hold on.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Variety</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Hollywood Returns To Work Despite COVID-19 Surge</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmibmKe2tMDOqZ%2Beql2jvK2tzaxkrZ2emsFuucCyZJ2dkqrBbrvUraqinJViwrR506GgrGWjqrqusdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
