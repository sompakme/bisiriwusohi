On Wednesday, March 25, the Bring the Funny judge, 34, kept herself busy while quarantined during the coronavirus crisis by whipping up a tuna casserole topped with jalapeño chips and cheddar cheese. When the dish was done, her husband, John Legend, carefully removed it from the oven."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One Twitter user asked where she could find the recipe for the meal while another remarked: “I feel like we would very much enjoy this.”</p><p>Still, this is the second time in as many months that Teigen has had to defend her culinary choices. In February, she shared a menu book that she created for her and Legend’s children — <a href=#>Luna</a>, 3, and <a href=#>Miles</a>, 22 months — and came under fire for <a href=#>topping their cereal with fresh fruit</a>. As some critics argued, not everyone has the resources to purchase fresh produce for their children.</p><p>The <a href=#>backlash</a> led the Cravings author to joke that she was going to “leave the internet,” but she ultimately stuck around and gave the critics, who deemed her out of touch, a piece of her mind. “‘You are so far removed from reality it’s scary’, over f–king BERRIES, and I say I want to leave the internet,” she tweeted back at the time. “And I am the one attacking. Amazing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjeqS4wKmqZpqRmLhurcWtnKtlo6S6prvNnmScmZyhsqV5x56pZqqVmLaxsYygqairo2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
