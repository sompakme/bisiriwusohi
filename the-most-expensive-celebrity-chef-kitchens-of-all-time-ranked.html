Her roomy home kitchen has been the setting for her show since 2005. Designed by Gwyn Duggan, the kitchen achieves a traditional aesthetic with brick and heavy ceiling beams, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. However, the layout is modern, with a deep fryer on the island at the top of Paula's wish list. The kitchen also features a cooking fireplace, soapstone counters, and a commercial convection-style double oven for baking. The fridge and freezer drawers are on the island, away from Paula's cooking zone. An appliance cabinet hides modern necessities and provides outlets to maintain the traditional look. The kitchen sink boasts a size comparable to that of a small bathtub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=guy-fieri>Guy Fieri</h2><p>Guy Fieri, the well-known face of the Food Network, resides in a 3,900 square-foot home with a spacious 900 square-foot kitchen. Within this kitchen lies an ensemble of his-n-hers refrigerators, a powerful mega burner capable of igniting a 20-gallon jambalaya pot, a 27,500 BTU gas wok burner, and a counter crafted from reclaimed barn wood. One notable feature of Guy's kitchen is the inclusion of hospital-style foot pedals, which allow for hands-free operation of the kitchen faucet, ensuring optimal hygiene during the cooking process.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Chef's Delight: Top 9 Restaurants Owned By Celebrity Chefs" href=#>The Chef's Delight: Top 9 Restaurants Owned By Celebrity Chefs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=julia-child>Julia Child</h2><p><a href=#>Julia Child, an influential figure in the realm of celebrity chefs</a>, owned a kitchen that, in contemporary terms, would be deemed relatively humble. This kitchen, which served as the backdrop for three of her cooking shows, now stands as an exhibit at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Julia and her husband Paul collaborated on the design, incorporating raised counters to accommodate Julia's towering frame. The kitchen's centerpiece is a versatile cooking island, which replaced the traditional kitchen table during television recordings.

The kitchen reflects Rachael's everyday style and features colorful dishes obtained near the Italian town where she got married. The backsplash features exquisite tiles imported from Italy. At the same time, the cooking range, adorned in Portuguese Blue, harmonizes with a refrigerator that underwent a matching paint job at an automotive body shop. The kitchen also includes a second, even more miniature fridge concealed behind a cupboard door and countertops made from the butcher block.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martha-stewart>Martha Stewart</h2><p><a href=#>Martha Stewart's $31 Million Manhattan apartment</a> features a galley-like kitchen with floor-to-ceiling cabinets. The sliding doors on the lower cabinets help maximize space and avoid kitchen collisions with open doors. In contrast, Martha's kitchen in her Lily Pond Lane home in the Hamptons is a culinary paradise. It includes shelves displaying her collection of McCoy pottery, metal cabinets topped with a forest of cake stands, a hanging rack organizing copper pots, Zinc-coated tin countertops, bookshelves full of cookbooks, and a table seating 12. The kitchen's design seamlessly blends practicality with visual appeal.</p><h2 id=curtis-stone>Curtis Stone</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aussie celebrity chef Curtis Stone bought a $3.1 million mansion in the Hollywood Hills.
