He got me a camel for my birthday,” Montana captioned a video of him walking the camel around his property. Swizz added, “Had to bring my brother a Big gift @saudibronx HBD @frenchmontana BX Zaaaaaaaa.”</p><p>Back in October, Swizz spoke with <a href=#><i>Variety</i></a> about his new passion: Camel racing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having discussed Verzuz at length with him earlier this year, we reached out, figuring he’d be game to talk about the just-announced second season of the series he started with fellow hitmaker Timbaland, which has become a lockdown phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers watching artists and producers, from Brandy vs. Monica to Snoop Dogg vs. DMX, go head-to-head playing their hits.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>Although he gave some clues about Verzuz Season 2 — it’s likely to start very soon and we should expect the unexpected (“You’ll guess the first one, but you’ll never guess the next five”) — Swizz has a different kind of competition in mind.</p><p>“Before you buy camels, you get to observe them,” he shared. “There’s test races where you can get to understand the attitude of the camels. Say, for instance, you’re seeing a camel suddenly go from the right lane to all the way across to the left — you can tell that that camel has a bad attitude. That might not be your best camel out of the gate. You want a camel that is focused, that listens to commands. You want camels from great homes and breeders. They get treated very well — amazing food, massages. Camels have to feel the love to give the love. You can’t have stressed-out camels in a race. Camels are sacred over there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, French’s birthday celebration arrives ahead of the release of his latest full-length offering, <i>Coke Boys 6. </i>Slated to drop Dec. 6, <i>CB6</i>: <i>The Money Heist Edition </i>will include the previously released single “Yes I Do,” as well as features from Babyface Ray, EST Gee, Rick Ross, Jadakiss, Benny the Butcher, Quavo, Fleurie, and the late Chinx.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b> Gisele Bündchen Purchases $11.5 Million Estate In Miami Near To Tom Brady</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Variety</a>, <a href=#>Complex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAuLXZs2SbnZGpx26%2BxKmmq6yVmbm6ecaarZ5llqeyr6%2FHZqSopqSWu6J5wGaamqWVoXqiv4yaZKChlql6p7vRZp%2Biq11ohbW0jJugq6yYma66ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
