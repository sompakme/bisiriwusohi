Her father was a tobacco farmer and music seemed to be <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">the young girl’s successful path in life.</a></p><p>Dolly Parton has a whopping $650 million net worth today but she <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">hasn’t forgotten her Tennessee roots</a>. In fact, she’s known for giving back to her hometown in massive ways, building a theme park, increasing the tourism industry in the area and friends would say she’s just as down to earth and friendly as her country roots instilled many years ago.</p><p>See how the 77-year-old superstar has earned her fortune.</p><h2 id=a-singer-since-birth>A Singer Since Birth</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dolly Parton began singing at the age of 9 in her local church congregation. The day after she graduated high school, the iconic songstress <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">moved to Nashville</a> and despite a rocky start, launched into stardom with hits like “Jolene”, “I Will Always Love You” and “9 to 5”. She’s had 25 number one singles over the years and while audiences may have been drawn in by her sparkling attire and large blonde wigs, they stuck around to hear the lyrics and sweet tone of each song.</p><h2 id=she-writes-the-majority-of-her-own-songs>She Writes the Majority of Her Own Songs</h2><p>The superstar estimates she’s written around 3,000 songs according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">MSN</a>, making her <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">music catalog</a> alone, worth $150 million. In addition, the business-savvy woman made a decision early in her career that’s proven fruitful for decades. When moving to Nashville as a young teen, she met up with her uncle, Bill Owens and the two founded publishing company Owe-Par, ensuring the vast majority of Dolly’s work is owned by her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=royalties-for-her-work>Royalties for Her Work</h2><p>The 1973 song “I Will Always Love You” is a perfect example of Parton’s business sense. At one time the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">King of Rock n’Roll</a> himself expressed interest in recording the song but when Elvis’ manager insisted she hand over half of the song’s publishing rights, Dolly declined. Nearly two decades later, she agreed to loan the song to producers for the upcoming blockbuster hit, The Bodyguard. The song sung by <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">music icon Whitney Houston</a> spent 14 weeks at the No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 and is still the best-selling single by a female artist of all time according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Parton earns a percentage of profit each time it’s played.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Dolly Parton Receives $100 Million Courage And Civility Award From Jeff Bezos</a></span></p><h2 id=dollywood>Dollywood</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1986, country’s favorite performer partnered with Herschend Family Entertainment to convert Silver Dollar City amusement park in Pigeon Forge, TN to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Dollywood </a>according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Love Money</a>.

The new resort is phase one of the park’s $500 million, 10-year investment plan and as co-owner, Parton’s stake is worth nearly $200 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-graced-the-big-screen-more-than-once>She’s Graced the Big Screen More than Once</h2><p>In 1980, Parton shared the screen with <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jane Fonda </a>and Lilly Tomlin in 9 to 5, also writing and singing the title track to the film and earning a Grammy for Best Country Song and Best Country Vocal Performance.

Vance.</p><h2 id=making-a-deal-with-netflix>Making a Deal with Netflix</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018 the “Coat of Many Colors” singer agreed to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">produce and star in several specials</a>, including Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings and the 2020 Emmy-winning film Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square to name a few. In recent interviews, Parton has shared her joy from working with the streaming giant and in addition, they’ve given her creative control with the projects, allowing her creativity and love for her fans to shine.</p><h2 id=partnering-with-img-licensing>Partnering with IMG Licensing</h2><p>What’s often surprises those that don’t know her is Parton’s uncanny ability to know a good business deal when she sees one. In 2019, the blonde-haired beauty agreed to a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">multi-year deal to expand her brand</a>, including her face on Duncan Hines bakeware collection, Williams Sonoma cookware collection and other global companies. Don’t be surprised if the next cake mix you purchase includes Dolly’s smiling face.</p><h2 id=an-unstoppable-marketing-tool>An Unstoppable Marketing Tool</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Parton launched her debut fragrance Scent From Above in the summer of 2021 on <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">shopping site </a>HSN, it became the fastest selling perfume in the past decade for the company.
