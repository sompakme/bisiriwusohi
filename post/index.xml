down rubadub square Not a chill to the window but a little to the air From another direction she was calling my eye It could be an illusion but I might as well try ..might as well try She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes And I knew without asking she was into the blues She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls I knew right away she was not like other girls…like other girls Well I ain’t never been right as I ain’t never been wrong As everything works out the way it does in this song Cause once in a while you get shown in the light In the strangest of places if you look at it right It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above Because the women took a lovin over me And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus Because I sold off all my personal property A tie-tie-dyed dress , she was a psychedelic mess We toured to the north, south, east and west We sold some mushroom tea, we sold some ecstasy, We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP And now I hear the police coming after me Yes now I hear the police coming after me The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair, She’s got the police coming after me Well there ain’t nothing wrong with the way she moves All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues And there ain’t nothin wrong with the love that’s in her eyes I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by… let her pass
