An <b>intron</b> is the part of the mRNA that gets cut out and does NOT code for proteins. The <b>exons</b> are the part that get linked together and go on to be translated into proteins.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-exons-and-introns-class-12></span>What is exons and introns Class 12?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Note: <b>Introns</b> are non-coding DNA sequences within a gene that, during maturation of the RNA element, are extracted by RNA splicing. <b>Exons</b> are protein-coding DNA sequences that require the requisite codons or data needed for the synthesis of proteins.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-introns-are-not-removed></span>What happens if introns are not removed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Not</b> only do the <b>introns not</b> carry information to build a protein, they actually have to be <b>removed</b> in order for the mRNA to encode a protein with the right sequence. <b>If</b> the spliceosome fails to <b>remove</b> an <b>intron</b>, an mRNA with extra “junk” in it will be made, and a wrong protein will get produced during translation.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-exons-removed></span>Are exons removed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (<b>exons</b>) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes <b>exons</b> and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are <b>removed</b> and <b>exons</b> joined to form a contiguous coding sequence.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-at-the-5-end></span>What happens at the 5 end?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>What happens at the 5</b>‘ <b>end</b> of the primary transcript in RNA processing? it receives a <b>5</b>‘ cap, where a form of guanine modified to have 3 phosphates on it is added after the first 20-40 nucleotides. They help ribosomes attach to the <b>5</b>‘ <b>end</b> of the mRNA once it reaches the cytoplasm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-exons-or-introns-get-removed></span>Do exons or introns get removed?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Introns</b> and <b>exons</b> are nucleotide sequences within a gene. <b>Introns</b> are <b>removed</b> by RNA splicing as RNA matures, meaning that they are not expressed in the final messenger RNA (mRNA) product, while <b>exons</b> go on to <b>be</b> covalently bonded to one another in order to create mature mRNA.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-purpose-of-introns></span>What is the purpose of introns?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Introns</b> are important for gene expression and regulation. The cell transcribes <b>introns</b> to help form pre-mRNA. <b>Introns</b> can also help control where certain genes are translated.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-two-functions-of-introns></span>What are two functions of introns?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>In particular, <b>introns</b> have a potential to serve as repositories of cis elements, participating in the regulation of transcription, and genome organization.</b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Transcription initiation.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Transcription termination.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Genome organization.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Nested genes.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-identify-introns></span>How do you identify introns?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-there-no-introns-in-prokaryotes></span>Why are there no introns in prokaryotes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Over time, <b>introns</b> were lost from <b>prokaryotes</b> as a way to make proteins more efficiently. <b>The</b> mixing and matching of exons from <b>the</b> same gene can lead to proteins with different functions. <b>Eukaryotes</b> might need this diversity in proteins because <b>they</b> have many types of cells all with <b>the</b> same set of genes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-bacteria-remove-introns></span>Can bacteria remove introns?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>All <b>introns</b>, whether in pre-tRNA or elsewhere, in contrast to those of <b>bacteria</b> and eukaryotes, are <b>removed</b> exclusively by tRNA splicing endonucleases.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-prokaryotes-not-have-nucleus></span>Why do prokaryotes not have nucleus?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Prokaryotes</b> do <b>have</b> their genomic DNA concentrated and localized to a small area within the cell (nucleoid region). So it’s not entirely accurate to say that <b>prokaryotes don’t have a nucleus</b>. The cell can release DNAses into the cytoplasm to degrade viral DNA, with reduced risk of degrading it’s own DNA.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-eukaryotes-have-exons></span>Do eukaryotes have exons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Explanation: The correct answer is that prokaryotes only <b>have exons</b>, whereas <b>eukaryotes have exons</b> and introns. As a result, in <b>eukaryotes</b>, when mRNA is transcribed from DNA, the introns <b>have</b> to be cut out of the newly synthesized mRNA strand. The <b>exons</b>, or coding sequences, are then joined together.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-introns-removed-in-prokaryotic-mrna></span>Are introns removed in prokaryotic mRNA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Both <b>prokaryotes</b> and eukaryotes process their ribosomal and transfer RNAs. The major difference in RNA processing, however, between <b>prokaryotes</b> and eukaryotes, is in the processing of messenger RNAs. The process of <b>removing</b> the <b>introns</b> and rejoining the coding sections or exons, of the <b>mRNA</b>, is called splicing.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-histones-present-in-prokaryotes></span>Are histones present in prokaryotes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Whereas eukaryotes wrap their DNA around proteins called <b>histones</b> to help package the DNA into smaller spaces, most <b>prokaryotes</b> do not <b>have histones</b> (with the exception of those species in the domain Archaea).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-prokaryotes-have-dna></span>Do prokaryotes have DNA?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Most <b>prokaryotes</b> carry a small amount of genetic material in the form of a single molecule, or chromosome, of circular <b>DNA</b>. The <b>DNA</b> in <b>prokaryotes</b> is contained in a central area of the cell called the nucleoid, which is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-the-dna-in-prokaryotes></span>Where is the DNA in prokaryotes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>1. <b>Prokaryotic</b> chromosomes are found in the nucleoid of <b>prokaryotic</b> cells, and they are circular in shape. Unlike eukaryotic cells, <b>prokaryotic</b> cells don’t have a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, their genetic material can be found in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-all-prokaryotes-harmful></span>Are all prokaryotes harmful?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Less than 1% of <b>prokaryotes</b> (<b>all</b> of them bacteria) are thought to be human pathogens, but collectively these species are responsible for a large number of the diseases that afflict humans. Besides pathogens, which have a direct impact on human health, <b>prokaryotes</b> also affect humans in many indirect ways.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-prokaryotes-examples></span>What are prokaryotes examples?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Prokaryotes</b> include the domains, Eubacteria and Archaea. <b>Examples</b> of <b>prokaryotes</b> are bacteria, archaea, and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-2-types-of-prokaryotes></span>What are the 2 types of prokaryotes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>two prokaryote</b> domains, Bacteria and Archaea, split from each other early in the evolution of life.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-5-examples-of-prokaryotic-cells></span>What are 5 examples of prokaryotic cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b><b>Prokaryotes Examples</b></b><ul class=i8Z77e><li class=TrT0Xe>Escherichia Coli Bacterium (E. coli)</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Streptococcus Bacterium.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Streptomyces Soil Bacteria.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Archaea.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-4-examples-of-eukaryotic-cells></span>What are 4 examples of eukaryotic cells?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Examples of eukaryotic cells</b> are plants, animals, protists, fungi.
