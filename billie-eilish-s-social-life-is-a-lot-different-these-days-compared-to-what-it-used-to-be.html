While speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fitzy & Wippa on Australia's Nova network</a>, Eilish shared that she often avoids going out in public due to the pressures of being in the spotlight.</p><p>"I used to go out and walk around and do stuff. And I don't do that as much," Eilish revealed. "Because life is a little different now."</p><p>Eilish acknowledged that touring could be particularly challenging. "When I was on tour, I was just scared to step outside because I was worried," she said. "I'm more chill about it now. Now I'm more comfortable in it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the difficulties of fame, Eilish has found ways to cope. She has found solace in nature and has taken up bike riding to help clear her mind. "I have been doing more stuff," she said. "But I've also just been busy. We were in New Zealand, and we went on a bike ride... I've been going out more for the last couple of years."</p><p>Eilish has been vocal about the importance of staying true to oneself and not getting caught up in the hype of fame. She emphasized the importance of staying authentic and not letting others dictate her happiness. "It's all just a matter of figuring out how to make yourself happy and not let other people do that for you," Eilish said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything Billie Eilish Has Said About Body Image</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eilish's message is important, especially in a society that values external validation and the approval of others. Her vulnerability and honesty serve as a reminder that even those in the public eye struggle with the pressures of fame and the impact it can have on personal well-being.</p><p>One person who Eilish feels comfortable with is her brother, and long-time collaborator, Finneas. But, the singer revealed she doesn't like working with other people.</p><h2 id=billie-eilish-on-working-and-collaborating-with-others>Billie Eilish On Working And Collaborating With Others</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar52150957.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eilish opened up about her creative process</a> and the importance of authenticity in her music. She revealed that she often writes songs in the middle of the night when she's alone and can fully focus on her thoughts and emotions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't like writing with people; I don't like working with people. I like doing it by myself," she said. "Because if I'm going to make something that's personal, it needs to be personal. I don't want to have to filter anything or explain anything."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eilish's commitment to authenticity is evident in her music</a> which often tackles heavy topics such as mental health and societal pressures. She explained that she wants her music to be relatable to her fans and to offer a sense of comfort and understanding.</p><p>"I'm not going to write a song that I don't feel or that I don't relate to," she said. "That's why people are drawn to my music because they feel like I'm talking to them. And I am."</p><p>Eilish also spoke about the importance of taking risks in her music and not being afraid to try new things. She cited her recent album, Happier Than Ever, as an example of pushing herself creatively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I didn't want to make the same thing twice; I didn't want to make the same album twice," she said.

"It's really valuable to have someone whose opinion you really value and who values your opinion."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Finneas O'Connell Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O'Connell also discussed the challenges of writing songs about personal experiences and the importance of being vulnerable in their music.</p><p>"I think the goal is always to make it as truthful as possible," he said. "And if that means being vulnerable, if that means revealing parts of yourself that you don't normally reveal, then that's what it takes to make great music. It's about connecting with people on a deeper level and sharing something that feels real and authentic."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXai8pLXApWSloZaaeqS0wKeenpxdmLyuvMCrnJ1lpKR6uLTArWSirF2qwKawjK2mZpqVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
