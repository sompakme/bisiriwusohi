But Jennifer’s love for designer houses brought her back to Beverly Hills in 2006, where she cashed out $13.5 million for a hillside residence designed by renowned architect Harold W. Levitt. After her expensive buy, she hired designer Stephen Shadley to transform the mansion into a new experience.</p><p>Jennifer Aniston spent a couple of years designing her 10000 square feet mansion into a Balinese-inspired retreat featuring pretty koi-ponds, centrally-heated travertine floors, and Brazilian cumaru eaves. She made it the perfect retreat for the classic Hollywood get-togethers and even named her home ‘Ohana’ as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. Jennifer bid goodbye to Ohana in 2011, selling it off for $38 Million, thus making a hefty profit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Right after selling her Beverly Hills mansion, Jennifer Aniston bought herself yet another lavish mansion in Bel-Air, California, while shelling out $20.97 million.

Located in Montecito, Santa Barbara, this lavish mansion is surrounded by high-profile neighbors, including the likes of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Ariana Grande, and Ellen DeGeneres, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Style</a>. This mansion was built in 1998 and is one of the most expensive properties in Jennifer’s impressive portfolio.</p><p>The lavish Mediterranean-style farmhouse is spread across 7 acres and features four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms after a series of extensive renovations over the years. The property is laden with an incredible sea view and mountain view. Oprah Winfrey acquired this property in 2021 for a reported $10.5 Million and, at that time, featured one large mansion alongside two small cottages and lush green compounds. Oprah has divided the property into two halves and sold the main farmhouse to Jennifer and the other two cottages to her personal trainer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Aniston’s substantial real estate portfolio perfectly encapsulates her enthusiasm for designer homes.
