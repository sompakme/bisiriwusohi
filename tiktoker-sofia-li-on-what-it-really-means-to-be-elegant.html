However, she's of the mind that many of those objections stem from a total misunderstanding.  In an exclusive interview with TheThings, the TikToker gave her take on where so many have gone so wrong in their perception of etiquette, and mused on what elegance really means in a modern world."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We just need to adapt."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-39-ve-got-new-rules>We've Got New Rules</h2><p>Sofia continues to say that, just as some protocols have existed for centuries, <a href=#>others need to be established today</a>, based on new developments.</p><p><strong>"Once upon a time, it was physically impossible to take a telephone to a social engagement,"</strong> she explains. <strong>"Now, <a href=#>our phones go everywhere with us</a>."</strong></p><p>Because of that, she concludes, <strong>"we just need to find the boundaries and limits to when we should use them,"</strong> - and based on many of Sofia's TikToks and Reels, it's safe to say that the table is not included in that list!</p><h2 id=sofia-responds-to-the-backlash-she-39-s-received>Sofia Responds To The Backlash She's Received</h2><p>Sofia boasts over 2 million followers on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> and 600k on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, so it's fair to say she has a massive fanbase!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not even Sofia is immune to the haters, and many a detractor can be found in the comments sections of her posts.</p><p>Interestingly enough, though, the model doesn't take the criticism personally.
