One of the best moments was when <strong>Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs sang</strong> her massive hit song "Fast Car," which was <strong>released in 1988</strong>. Since <a href=#>Chapman disappeared years before the popular cover</a>, fans loved seeing her perform again.</p><p>While <a href=#>Chapman made money from Nicki Minaj sampling "Fast Car,"</a> she actually has a fairly low net worth.

This number may be low because <strong>Chapman's last album was released in 2008 </strong>and she stopped making music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/why-tracy-chapman-vanished-from-the-music-industry-long-before-luke-combs-_fast-car_-cover_.jpg><p>While the exact amount that the singer has earned from "Fast Car" is unknown, much of her net worth seems to be from the success of this song. According to Business Insider, Chapman <strong>sold more than six million copies</strong> in the U.S. of her first album, "Tracy Chapman," which was released in 1988. Since this album included "Fast Car," it's no wonder that it did so well. It also made it to number one on Billboard and people loved the beautiful, emotional lyrics.</p><p>Tracy Chapman's Eight Albums</p><ul><li>"Tracy Chapman" (1998)</li><li>"Crossroads" (1989)</li><li>"Matters of the Heart" (1992)</li><li>"New Beginning" (1995)</li><li>"Telling Stories" (2000)</li><li>"Let It Rain" (2002)</li><li>"Where You Live" (2005)</li><li>"Our Bright Future" (2008)</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Luke-Combs-and-wife.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>One Of Luke Combs' Songs About His Wife Has An Absolutely Shocking Origin</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Some of Luke Combs’ songs about his wife Nicole Hocking include “Better Together”, “When It Rains It Pours”, and “Nothing Like You”.</span><p>Considering that Luke Combs' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cover of "Fast Car"</a> made him one of the most talked-about artists of 2023, fans can assume that Tracy Chapman has made a lot of money as a result. According to Billboard, Chapman has earned <strong>$500,000 thanks to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publishing royalties</a></strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> for the song</a>. Luminate reported that between March 17th and June 8th 2023, "Fast Car" was streamed 154 million times on Apple Music and Spotify. Since other artists have covered the song, she has likely earned some money from those recordings. However, Combs' cover has been the most popular.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tracy-chapman-performing.jpg><p>According to Today.com, Chapman said that she was happy about the cover, and Combs responded that he was glad to hear that. Combs said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The success of my cover is unreal and I think it’s so cool that Tracy is getting recognized and has reached new milestones. I love that she is out there feeling all the love and that she gave me a shout-out! Thank you, Tracy!”</p><p>Some of the other musicians who have covered Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car":</p><ul><li>Boyce Avenue (2010)</li><li>Dakota and Jonas Blue (2015)</li><li><a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> (2015)</li><li>Sam Smith (2016)</li><li>Luke Combs (2023)</li></ul><p>However, as Today.com and other publications have noted, there has been a serious discussion about Combs' cover of "Fast Car." Many have pointed out the uncomfortable fact that a male country singer's version of the song has been so beloved when Chapman wouldn't have been so accepted in the country music world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tracy Chapman would likely have continued to sell albums if she kept releasing them, it seems like she wanted to step away from the industry. When she spoke about Luke Combs' cover of "Fast Car," people hadn't heard from her in a long time. Many people mention her social and political activism, and this seems to be how she has been spending her time in the past few decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tracy-chapman-smiling-1.jpg><p>In 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapman talked about her final album </a>with The Guardian, along with American politics. The Guardian noted that the singer supported causes such as Free Tibet, the American Foundation for Aids Research, and Amnesty International.</p><p>In 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chapman was interviewed by Planet Rock Profiles</a> and shared that she was glad that her debut did so well. She said:</p><p>"It was a gift to have had the kind of success that I had with the first record because it gave me a lot of creative freedom from that point on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-tracy-chapman-39-s-quot-fast-car-quot-about>What Is Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" About?</h2><p>Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" tells a sad story about a woman wanting to leave the small town where she is living and the difficult circumstances of her life. According to The Guardian, Chapman grew up in Cleveland with her sister and mother. They received welfare and didn't have much money. It's clear that the singer put a lot of what she was feeling into the lyrics.</p><p>Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" Lyrics</p><ul><li>"You got a fast car Is it fast enough so we can fly away?

That’s why I write songs and I don’t write books. People always want to know about the person that writes, and the easiest thing to do is assume that they write about themselves and that you can gain insight into what the writer thinks and feels. But that’s not necessarily true."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/tracy-chapman.jpg><p>Chapman continued, "In songs, you take on different personas and different characters, and try and put yourself in their place. Plus, I think that if you go about explaining everything about a song, it’s gone.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">history of "Fast Car"</a> proves that Tracy Chapman was meant to be successful. According to Far Out Magazine, she was performing in cafes near Tufts University when a student named Brian Koppelman, whose dad <strong>Charles Koppelman was a music publisher</strong>, heard her perform and connected her with his dad. They worked together and Chapman's music career began.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mTrnqktMCppJqmo2K7psCMsKarrJhiubDDjJ2crKiZqbJuuc6sq2aon6XCra3RZqqoppeoeqbCxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
