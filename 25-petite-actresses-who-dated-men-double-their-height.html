There is a little bit of everything in there. There are tall actresses dating short actors, young actresses dating old actors, superstars dating virtually unknown people, and the list goes on and on. You could literally play a mix-and-match game and come up with all kinds of combinations and probably find a real-life example of that combination you came up with if you search hard enough in the Hollywood dating pool. That being said, we would like to bring you a list where we focused on one of these many kinds of relationships that happen within the larger realm of the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What we would like to talk about today are 25 petite actresses who have found love with men who are incredibly taller than they are. And yes, we will be including someone who dated Shaquille O’Neal, because it would be impossible to make a list like this without that little gem in the middle. Either way, while we thought it would be easy to find instances in which actresses are dating guys who are taller than them, we never thought that there would be so many cases in which the height difference is almost ridiculous. But since an image is worth a thousand words, let’s stop wasting time and get started on this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-alexander-and-shaquille-o-neal><strong>Nicole Alexander And Shaquille O’Neal</strong></h2><p>Sorry, we couldn’t help ourselves but start our list with what is perhaps the most ridiculous height difference in a couple ever. Reality TV stars are actresses, and with that in mind, we thought it would be a blasphemy of us if we were to refrain from talking about the relationship between Nicole Alexander and <a href=#>Shaquille O’Neal</a>. Nicole became famous for her reality TV appearances in shows like Flavor of Love&nbsp;and I Love Money. With that fame, she got to meet one of the most dominant basketball players of all time. As a matter of fact, we think it would be okay to call Shaq the greatest beast who ever entered an NBA court. And that is because</p><p><strong>he is a 7’1” 325-pound man. Meanwhile, his former girlfriend stands tall at 5’2”.</strong></p><p>Yes, it is almost a 2-feet difference between these two.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-and-ryan-reynolds><strong>Scarlett Johansson And Ryan Reynolds</strong></h2><p>When it comes to star power in Hollywood, not many couples can claim to have the combined fandom of the infamous Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds union of a while back. These two were still not the movie stars they are today, but they were already incredibly famous when they started dating in 2007. The couple was together for quite some time, and the paparazzi loved to follow them around and try to find every little dent they could about the relationship. We know that is what paparazzi do with every single Hollywood relationship, but it seemed like they were almost too keen on finding something wrong with Scarlett and Ryan. Eventually, of course, there was something wrong, and they got divorced in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Still, to this day, their 10-inch height difference is one of the biggest we found in Hollywood</strong></p><p>as Ryan is 6’2” and Scarlett 5’4”.</p><h2 id=sarah-michelle-gellar-and-freddie-prinze-jr><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar And Freddie Prinze Jr.</strong></h2><p>The height difference between the two parts of this couple is nothing less than 11 inches, but that is still not the most impressive thing about the relationship between these two. Anyone who follows celebrities in any capacity knows that for a relationship to endure more than five years is already a win in Hollywood. Most often, we get to see celebrities getting married in one year. And then, less than 12 months afterward, they are already broken up and planning the next relationship to attract the news crews.</p><p><strong>The thing about Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. is that these two have managed to stick together no matter the bumps they hit along the road.</strong></p><p>To prove that point, we can’t help but feel happy to say that these two have been married since 2002.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=salma-hayek-and-edward-norton><strong>Salma Hayek And Edward Norton</strong></h2><p>The relationship only lasted a few years, and it did not make as much of an impression on the paparazzi and the media as many imagined they would at first, but the union between these two stars of the big screen was interesting for many reasons. The biggest one here was that they survived a couple of years despite an astounding 10-inch height difference. And no, we don’t think the height difference plays much of a factor in a couple breaking up, but it still sounded funny to say it like that. Either way,</p><p><strong>Salma Hayek is only 5’2” tall while her former beloved stood tall at a good 6 feet.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, while the relationship did not last long, it didn’t seem to have any adverse effects on either of those two people as they remained friendly to each other and both eventually married and are happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth><strong>Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth</strong></h2><p>When it comes to celebrity couples these days, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have to be one of the most interesting ones we could talk about. The first reason for that is they are two of the biggest movie stars of their generation. Yeah, their generation is still young, but it is hard to imagine that any couple of a similar age will have as much star power as these two together.</p><p>We say movie stars, but that is not completely true since Miley has only appeared in a few movies, but she is the kind of musician who has enough star power to make any movie she appears in an immediate hit. That being said, another interesting thing about their relationship is the difference in height between the two of them. It is a 10-inch difference that comes from Liam being 6’3” tall while Miley being only 5’5” tall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-jim-toth><strong>Reese Witherspoon And Jim Toth</strong></h2><p>In almost every single list we make that has to do with dating, we can usually find at least one or two returning offenders. A list of actresses who like dating taller man would be no different. In this case, the returning offender we seem to find time and time again was American actress Reese Witherspoon. Reese is well-known throughout Hollywood and the world for her world-class acting and her fun personality. It is impossible to deny that this woman is one of the best actresses of her generation. After all, Reese has won an Academy Award and a couple of Golden Globes to prove her point. But she does have her peculiarities—in this case, her tendency to date taller men. That is not surprising since</p><p><strong>Reese is only 5’1” tall, but the height differences are still impressive.</strong></p><p>The first one we found was her relationship to talent agent Jim Toth, who is 11 inches taller than her.</p><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-jake-gyllenhaal><strong>Reese Witherspoon And Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></h2><p>As we said before, Reese Witherspoon is a returning offender, and talent agent Jim Toth was not the only guy she dated who was significantly taller than her. The same thing happened when Reese decided to start dating fellow actor, Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>At 6 feet tall, Jake is a good 11 inches taller than his former beloved.</strong></p><p>The relationship between these two lovebirds lasted for only a couple of years, but that was enough for people to recognize it as one of the strongest bonds in the industry. There are so many things about this relationship that we could talk about, like the fact that while they met on set for the 2007 flick&nbsp;Rendition, they never appeared on screen together. There is also the fact that despite having parted ways, the two of them are still very fond of each other, which is surprising in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reese-witherspoon-and-ryan-phillippe><strong>Reese Witherspoon And Ryan Phillippe</strong></h2><p>Last but not least, we had to talk about the first marriage of Reese Witherspoon’s life. That sounded a bit ominous since she only had a couple and is still married to her second husband, but the union between Reese and fellow actor Ryan Phillippe was such a publicized affair that when they broke up, it just seemed like the world wasn’t ready for it. The two of them met at her 21st birthday party all the way back in 1997. Surprisingly, this was a relationship that started at a party but managed to last for almost a decade as they only separated in 2006. As a couple, Reese and Ryan had two children together. As for their height difference, it is not as impressive as the 11-inch difference in the two other relationships we talked about, but</p><p><strong>the two of them are still a good 8 inches apart</strong></p><p>as Ryan is 5’9” tall.</p><h2 id=lisa-bonet-and-jason-momoa><strong>Lisa Bonet And Jason Momoa</strong></h2><p>Let’s talk about one of the most recent couples in Hollywood that have an impressive height difference between the two of them. If you have watched any movie that Jason Momoa has been in, you know very well that this guy is not a regular human being. Not only is Jason one of the strongest guys you will see in Hollywood, but he is also one of the tallest men in the industry. Aquaman over here displays an enviable figure in his 6’4” frame. Meanwhile, he has just married one of the most petite actresses in Hollywood, as</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Lisa Bonet is a whole 14 inches shorter than him in her 5’2” frame.</strong></p><p>In terms of their relationship, they have been together since 2005, and many people claim that they have been married since 2007. However, they only made an official announcement of their union in 2017.</p><h2 id=christina-ricci-and-owen-benjamin><strong>Christina Ricci And Owen Benjamin</strong></h2><p>This is one of those couples with such a massive height difference that we have to start talking about it from the get-go. The difference between Christina Ricci and her former fiancé is nothing less than 17 inches. Yes, back when she was dating actor and comedian Owen Benjamin in the late 2000’s, Christina was part of one of the funniest couples that were sought after by paparazzi because of their height difference.</p><p><strong>Owen is a very tall man, standing at 6’6” while his former love is actually a pretty short woman at 5’1”.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That being said, they seemed to be a pretty good couple, and given how fast things seem to move in the world of celebrities, having a relationship for almost 2 years and even getting engaged could have been called a win for these two lovebirds.</p><h2 id=mila-kunis-and-ashton-kutcher><strong>Mila Kunis And Ashton Kutcher</strong></h2><p>At 6’2” tall, it would be tough for Ashton Kutcher to find a taller woman to date, but that doesn’t seem to bother him in the least. And it certainly shouldn’t, since this guy is doing very well in the dating department while he is looking for ladies who are shorter than him. The latest catch, and certainly the one he hopes will be the last, is fellow actress</p><p><strong>Mila Kunis who, at 5’4” tall, is a good 10 inches shorter than him.</strong></p><p>Their relationship is one that divides the crowd because of a few factors. Of course, there are those who are delighted with the fact that the two stars of That '70s Show have finally fulfilled whatever kind of prophecy they had and tied the knot in real life. But there are also those who are not too fond of the relationship and even claim that it is fake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katy-perry-and-russell-brand><strong>Katy Perry And Russell Brand</strong></h2><p>Katy Perry is not a short woman by any parameters. If we are to believe the Internet, the average height for women in the United States is around 5’4”, and Katie is well above that average at 5’8”. The superstar singer has been dazzling the world for as long as we can remember, and one of the things she became known for was her marriage with Russell Brand. Now, we all know how it went downhill, and the relationship ended up being not what fans of either of those people thought it would be. But their “love” still made enough headlines for them to be considered one of the most newsworthy couples of the past few years.</p><p>One of the reasons why they were so newsworthy was that despite the fact that Katy is well above the average height for women, she still looked small next to Russell who is 6’1” tall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-richie-and-joel-madden><strong>Nicole Richie And Joel Madden</strong></h2><p>Acting might not be her main gig, but Nicole Richie has a filmography that would put a lot of professional actresses to shame. The American fashion designer has made appearances and cameos in dozens of television shows and was even nominated for a few Teen Choice Awards. She never won any of those awards, but it was still something we thought we should mention. In the love department, this is one happy woman, who found her true love after she finally decided to cut ties with her former friend, Paris Hilton. Just one year after that friendship breakup, Nicole met and started dating the lead singer of Good Charlotte, Joel Madden. The couple dated for a long time and eventually married in 2010.</p><p><strong>They are still happy and together despite the 7-inch height difference between the two,</strong></p><p>as Nicole is 5’2” tall and Joel is 5’9” tall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-and-olivier-sarkozy><strong>Mary-Kate Olsen And Olivier Sarkozy</strong></h2><p>Yes, yes, you are probably familiar with Sarkozy, but he is probably not who you think he is. If you are someone who follows the news, you might remember the last name Sarkozy because of Olivier’s brother, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was the president of France from 2007 all the way to 2012. Yeah, that seems to be one powerful last name to have if you live in Europe. Not just a powerful one, but one that is almost a synonym too wealth. While Nicolas might’ve been the one who got to call himself the president of France, Olivier is one of the richest men around since he is a banker with quite some pull around Europe. That reputation sure had to play a part in him meeting and eventually marrying Mary-Kate Olsen.</p><p><strong>They have been married since 2011 and have an impressive 13-inch height difference</strong></p><p>as Mary Kate is 5’2” and Olivier is 6’3”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jada-pinkett-smith-and-will-smith><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith And Will Smith</strong></h2><p>Jada Pinkett-Smith is a great actress. This 46-year-old lady has played a part in almost every single genre of cinema throughout her career. She has appeared in movies like The Matrix Reloaded and even had voice acting roles in juggernaut franchises like Madagascar. However, it must be tough for her to come home and have people within the family comparing her career to that of her husband’s. This is something she definitely should not do because it is nearly impossible to compare oneself to the greatness of Will Smith. The guy has been everywhere and has done it all, and he is arguably one of the best actors of all time. Not only that, but</p><p><strong>Will also stands a good 14 inches taller than his wife,</strong></p><p>as he is 6’2” tall and she is 5 feet tall.</p><h2 id=kristen-bell-and-dax-shepard><strong>Kristen Bell And Dax Shepard</strong></h2><p>We have seen all kinds of height differences, but it is hard to deny that the most interesting ones are always whenever an actress is a whole foot shorter than her husband or boyfriend. That is exactly the case in the relationship between Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. These two Hollywood stars have been together for quite some time, as they began dating in 2007, got engaged in 2010, eventually married in 2013, and are still together to this day. The couple has two beautiful daughters end seem to be keen on making this relationship last a lifetime. Since we were talking about the height difference, we might as well put some numbers in front of you so you can get a good idea of what we are working with here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Kristen is 5’1” tall and Dax is 6’2” tall.</strong></p><p>Yeah, that is 13 inches in height difference, and that’s more than a foot.</p><h2 id=hayden-panettiere-and-wladimir-klitschko><strong>Hayden Panettiere And Wladimir Klitschko</strong></h2><p>This is by far one of the craziest height differences you will see on this list and definitely the biggest that does not involve a basketball player. We are talking about the interesting marriage between American actress Hayden Panettiere and Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko.</p><p>These two lovebirds met in 2009 at a book launch party. Yeah, can you even believe this? A famous actress and the world heavyweight boxing champion met at a book launch party, started a relationship, and eventually got married. It seems like a joke. But it is indeed what happened, and that 2009 book launch party sparked a relationship that lasts to this day. But that is not what you are here for. You are here to hear about the crazy height difference between these two. Starting from the bottom, Hayden is 5 feet tall, and ending all the way at the top with Wladimir who is 6’6” tall, tallying up to a ridiculous 18-inch height difference.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isla-fisher-and-sacha-baron-cohen><strong>Isla Fisher And Sacha Baron Cohen</strong></h2><p>Born in the Middle Eastern nation of Oman, Isla Fisher is one of those people who have a very diverse background—starting from her birth in the Middle East, to her Scottish parents, to her growing up in Australia, and to her finally moving to the United States to become an actress. One thing we should point out is that despite that incredibly diverse early life story, Isla holds Australian nationality and not the nationality of her parents nor the country she was born in.</p><p>When it comes to relationships, there is nowhere to run other than to talk about her relationship with Sacha Baron Cohen. The two of them met at a party in Australia back in 2002 and have been together ever since. With a height difference of 12 inches, this happily-married couple has three children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox-and-brian-austin-green><strong>Megan Fox And Brian Austin Green</strong></h2><p>Megan Fox is arguably the most famous actress of her generation. She is one of those people who helped define an entire genre during her appearances in the Transformers franchise and everything she did in-between. Megan was a symbol of beauty and whatever else people attached to her image. With all of that, many people thought she would eventually start dating and marry a celebrity with similar star power to hers. Meanwhile, what many people might not have known is that during all of those years, she had already found love and was dating the same guy.</p><p>It all started in 2004 when an 18-year-old Megan met Brian Austin Green who was 30 at the time, and the two of them started dating. These two kept dating, eventually married in 2010, and are together to this day. In the height department, their difference is not that crazy, as the 6-foot Brian is only 8 inches taller than his wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-hudgens-and-austin-butler><strong>Vanessa Hudgens And Austin Butler</strong></h2><p>A lot of the couples on this list are older people who have been in the spotlight for quite some time, so we thought it would be good to add some young love to this mix. We found this young love in the relationship between Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler. She might be three years older than him, but Austin more than makes up for it in how taller he is than his girlfriend. The Shannara Chronicles&nbsp;star is</p><p><strong>almost an entire foot taller than Vanessa, as Austin is 6 feet tall and she is 5’1” tall.</strong></p><p>But the height difference is not the only interesting thing about these two, especially given the fact that they are a young couple in Hollywood. They have been in a relationship since 2011. Yes, they have been together for more than seven years in this prolific industry despite how young they are, which is impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries><strong>Kim Kardashian And Kris Humphries</strong></h2><p>Their relationship might’ve been one of the&nbsp;biggest publicity stunts in the history of Hollywood and everything that involves relationships between celebrities and professional athletes. But it is hard to deny that Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries were a couple that attracted lots of eyes that were keen on seeing what these two were doing every day of their lives. While everyone who has followed the Kardashians knew very well what Kim’s routine would look like on any given day, it had to be interesting for that audience to see glimpses of what the life of a professional athlete is like, as Kris became a part of the reality TV show for as long as their marriage lasted. One of the most interesting things about this relationship must be one of the peculiar things about any relationship involving a basketball player.</p><p><strong>There was an 18-inch height difference between the two</strong></p><p>as Kris is 6’9” and Kim is 5’3”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-and-lamar-odom><strong>Khloe Kardashian And Lamar Odom</strong></h2><p>Since we are already riding the Kardashian train, we might as well go all the way to the final station. Kim Kardashian might be the most famous of the Kardashian sisters, but she is not the tallest. The tallest woman in the Kardashian clan is her sister, Khloe, who stands tall at 5’10”. Yes, Khloe is very tall, which brings us the question of how can she always find a taller man to date? The answer here is probably that she knows very well where to look for them.</p><p>If you are a celebrity, one of the best places to find taller men must be an NBA court, and Khloe knows her way around a basketball court like few others. She has dated several ballplayers, the most known relationship of those being the time when she dated and married former Laker great Lamar Odom, who is 12 inches taller than her at 6’10”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kourtney-kardashian-and-scott-disick><strong>Kourtney Kardashian And Scott Disick</strong></h2><p>From the tallest woman in the Kardashian clan to one of the shortest, we take an entry dedicated to Khloe and move it down to her sister Kourtney, who is also fond of dating taller men. That being said, at 5 feet tall, it would be hard for dear Kourtney Kardashian to find a man shorter than her to date. All fun and games aside, one of her most prominent relationships was to Scott Disick. As a matter of fact, when it comes to Kardashian relationships, the love between Scott and Kourtney had to be one of the longest-lasting ones the family has seen in a while. The two of them started dating in 2006, and their breakup was only reported in 2015. That is almost a decade.</p><p>As for the height difference, it is of about 11 inches since Scott is 5’11” tall.</p><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-and-tristan-thompson><strong>Khloe Kardashian And Tristan Thompson</strong></h2><p>We said we were going to ride the Kardashian train all the way to the final station, and we were not lying. Another thing we mentioned in one of the previous entries on this list was that Khloe Kardashian is one of the people who know how to look for and attract taller men. That being said, it is not too surprising to learn that Khloe has had more than one relationship with NBA players. NBA players are undoubtedly taller than 99 percent of the other celebrities around the globe. Even if she was dating a point guard, that would have been enough to put that relationship on this list.

Sometimes, it is an impressive height difference. Other times, people make the news because they are dating someone who is a lot younger or a lot older than them. But sometimes, a relationship can fulfill both of those duties. That is the case of the new relationship between Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima. Yeah, after almost a decade of being with the same man, Kourtney decided it was time for her to enjoy life and see what it was like to date someone who is a lot younger than she is. The man she found was Younes, who is 14 years younger than her, which seems to be only fair since</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>he is also 14 inches taller than she is.</strong></p><p>Yeah, the perfect relationship, isn’t it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYmp6sbHToqueZZGYwbOx0qycrGWnnbxusMCtnJ1lnZq7brDOrpmlnV2ptaa10WafnqGXncFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
