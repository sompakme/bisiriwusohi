The 2020 show — which only spanned eight episodes, on purpose — featured all female producers, was based on a book by a woman who was involved in the show's production (though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Hulu show is a bit different than the book</a>), had a culturally diverse cast,&nbsp;and was heavily influenced by Reese Witherspoon.</p><p>Reese was the co-lead of the series alongside Kerry, and as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a> confirmed, Reese has long been a proponent for strong female leads, fair pay for all actors, and diversifying her income streams beyond stereotypical industry limitations. Seriously, she's Elle Woods personified. Except with less pink.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon Makes $1 Million Per Episode On 'Big Little Lies' But She's Doubling Elsewhere</a></span></p><p>Basically, the perfect storm meant that Kerry Washington's earnings on 'Little Fires' would be equitable&nbsp;and that the project was practically guaranteed to be amazing. But enough about Reese and her accomplishments. Kerry's a force in her own right, and fortunately, her pay for 'Fires' reflects that.</p><p>The hard figures are tough to come by, but&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleCaster</a> notes that estimates for Washington's pay average around $1.1 million per episode. That means about $7.7 million for the whole project, which makes sense since Kerry's reported net worth saw a jump of over five million between 2019 and 2020 (when the show came out).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall that though Kerry rocked it on 'Scandal' for six years as Olivia Pope, her initial salary wasn't that impressive, at least in terms of Hollywood income.&nbsp;StyleCaster says Kerry made about $250K per episode by the end of the series.</p><p>Washington also wound up with executive producer credits later in the show's run, which led to an income boost, suggests&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>. Kerry's original pay: $80K per episode. It's hard to compare apples to oranges in terms of actor pay depending on how successful a show is, where it airs, and other factors. But it seems like that's a bit of a slight on Kerry, who was the lead and is also a powerhouse actress who's been in the industry a long time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which makes it even better that partnering with Reese bumped her into the $1M club for per-episode earnings. Sure, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerry's been fighting against racial inequality for decades</a>, but the income disparities are a related issue that are sometimes hard to highlight. This time, though, someone else saw Kerry's worth and ensured she was paid prime for it.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">#promnetflix Trends As Twitter Users Post Rave Reviews For 'The Prom'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lm5q%2Fs8WMsJisoJmjtLW7zWakmqOVYrmqwNOlnGaemaeytHnEr5yrsaedsrOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
