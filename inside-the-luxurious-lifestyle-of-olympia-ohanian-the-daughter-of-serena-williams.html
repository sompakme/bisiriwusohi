The two-story, 140-seat theatre inside the building is named after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams' four-year-old daughter Olympia</a>.

According to <a href=#>Williams who has achieved so much success</a>, she wants to spend more time at her beautiful Miami home to get some rest. Behind the bookshelf in her home is a secret media room that people can only access through the hidden door that can be seen behind the sculptures of contemporary chairs.</p><p>When one step inside, one will find a stage stocked with instruments, a bar, velvety chairs, and a bright neon sign that reads Serenade; it's the ideal setting for a family karaoke night. Olympia's unique pink castle bed was constructed specifically for her, and it features a built-in slide and a chandelier so that she can truly feel like a princess. It also looks like she has a toy-filled playroom with bright storage cubes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-s-luxurious-vacation-and-lavish-gifts>Olivia's Luxurious Vacation And Lavish Gifts</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympia Ohanian</a> is undoubtedly making the most of her summer.
