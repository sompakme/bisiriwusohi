The Caribbean consists of more than 700 islands, all in the Caribbean Sea. From Mexico, Aruba, Bermuda, the Bahamas and more, holidaymakers have plenty of options. The tourism sector makes a huge contribution to the economies of the Caribbean, and the offerings are becoming more luxurious as the years go on. In 2013, there were 1.8% more visitors to the Caribbean than in the previous year, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. This is only a modest increase but took the annual figure to more than 25 million visitors. About seven million of these come by cruise ship. It’s expected that overall tourist spending is about $28.1 billion per year. We’ve narrowed the Caribbean down to a list of 10 top Caribbean destinations and the celebrities who have been there in recent years. Find out who spent $30,000 per night on a hotel suite in Puerto Rico, which island is a favorite of Oprah Winfrey and where the New York City mayor played golf recently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-aruba-tom-cruise-and-son><b>10.
