Surprisingly, the Hollywood actors failed to build a long-term bond during the filming of the Oscar-nominated movie, but luckily they rekindled their relationship years later.</p><p>Five tears later the two actors would work together on 2010's Love & Other Drugs. This romantic-comedy, which is filled with raunchy scenes, ultimately helped their relationship grow.</p><p>Despite their relationship starting off a little rocky, Gyllenhaal is now a big fan of Anne Hathaway and has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">praised her as being “A massive talent</a>, and a really brilliant and sometimes confusing human."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She’s one of the most adventurous people I’ve ever met. . . . When I first met her, and even now, even knowing her for a long time, Anne is somebody who would just not really want to get into the party—she is the life of the party and the person who will jump off the cliff first. She really is! I love contradictions in people, she happens to be that. I think she’s probably one of the most talented actresses of our generation.”</p><h2 id=why-jake-gyllenhal-and-anne-hathway-didn-39-t-become-friends-during-brokeback-mountain>Why Jake Gyllenhal And Anne Hathway Didn't Become Friends During Brokeback Mountain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/anne-hathaway-and-jake-gyllenhaal-in-brokeback-mountain.jpg><p>Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal weren't the best of friends whilst filming Brokeback Mountain.

"It was more of a bump-into-each-other casual thing. I was always happy to see you [Gylenhaal], but we didn't really reach out to each other. I kind of felt more bonded to you than I felt that we were friends."</p><p>Since appearing in Love & Other Drugs they have become friends and hang out. "I now have a go-to cooking teacher, which is wonderful," Anne told Entertainment Weekly, admitting she texts Gyllenhaal questions about cooking.</p><p>"The other night, Annie texted me, and she was like, 'How can I make bread crumbs quickly?' I wrote all these instructions, and it took me 15 or 20 minutes. And she goes, 'Oh, yeah, I already thought of that. That doesn’t work,'" the Nightcrawler actor explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-sex-scenes-helped-anne-hathaway-and-jake-gyllenhaal-39-s-friendship>How Sex Scenes Helped Anne Hathaway And Jake Gyllenhaal's Friendship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/love-and-other-drugs.jpg><p>Five years after making Brokeback Mountain, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway paired up again for Love & Other Drugs.

He explained, "So to ease her and make her feel comfortable, I was always like, 'Where do you want me to go? What do you want me to do? What do you feel comfortable doing?' Anne was always like, 'You do your thing and I'll do my thing. I'm fine on my own!'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We wanted to push it,” Gyllenhaal told the LA Times about the sex scenes. “One of those avenues was when the sheets come off, you don’t cover your breast, you don’t cover a part of your body after you’ve slept with someone you’re falling in love with five or six times.”</p><h2 id=is-a-taylor-swift-song-about-anne-hathaway>Is A Taylor Swift Song About Anne Hathaway?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/when-jake-gyllenhaal-called-himself-lucky-for-having-cinematic-sx-with-anne-hathaway-saying-i-recommend-getting-in-bed-with-her-to-any-man-01.jpg><p>Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal were so close that their friendship became part of a<strong><a href=#> Taylor Swift </a></strong>fan theory.</p><p>Jake and Taylor were infamously involved during the filming of Love & Other Drugs, which is <a href=#>depicted in her song "All Too Well."</a> One line of the song reads, "Not weeping in a party bathroom / Some actress asking me what happened, you / That's what happened, you."
