The house certainly depicts a dynamic personality with neutral floors and a soothing ambiance in contrast to the emerging artists and <i>shroom room</i>.</p><p>In June, Demi sold her Sunset Strip mansion for a whopping $8.25 million. It cost relatively less to purchase this new farmhouse, the estimated price being $7 million.</p><h2 id=a-curated-farmhouse-that-is-also-a-music-studio>A Curated Farmhouse That Is Also A Music Studio</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The house came like a blank canvas for the <i>Skin of my Teeth</i> singer; at the time of purchase, it was a cozy minimalist space with black and white tones. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, she immediately teamed up with Argyle Design founders Kate Bell and James Andrew to turn this 8,500 square feet luxurious mansion into a lifetime experience. Each room came with its persona and style. The furniture is both modern and vintage pieces that are mix-matched under the colorful backdrop.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Ryan Seacrest’s $51 Million Beverly Hills home</a></span></p><p>It is here that <a href=#>the Grammy award-nominated singer</a> worked on her eighth album <i>Holy Fvck. </i>The whimsical residence highlights artwork from underrepresented communities throughout the living space. She took help from Eva Seta, director of communications at the Museum of Contemporary Art, LA, to curate each art piece. Artists such as Lilian Martinez, Yasmine Nasser Diaz, and Lola Rose Thompson adorn the walls. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, the <i>Heart Attack</i> singer went through a resurrection of pop-punk style and rock roots while designing the modern farmhouse. Thus inspiring her to create her eighth rock album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-psychedelic-atmosphere>A Psychedelic Atmosphere</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, the designer duo from Argyle Design has incorporated subtle sarcasm while placing the decor around the house. Mushroom-shaped stools, butt vases, and breast-shaped salt and pepper shakers. The Tangled wallpaper by Porter Teleo compliments the yellow velvet sofa by Mario Bellini in the living room. A black fireplace with a Saber rug completes the whole look. The dining room has an underwater theme; fish and sea shells are incorporated to give it an aquatic vibe. A leopard print rug under the Warren Platner dining set gives off wild aesthetics. The Uchiwa wall sconces flake the artwork <i>Truth or Dare</i> done in subtle white.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A set of Azalea mink bar stools are seen near the minimalist kitchen island. The breakfast nook is done in Gucci Lilies wallpaper. A round black Tulip table with four Mario Bellini chairs makes the corner cozy. Demi’s favorite room is the glam room which is done in pink and emerald tones. A salon-style shampoo bowl adorns the aesthetics, and the yellow neon sign spelling <i>You are never fully dressed without a smile </i>is her all-time positive vibe quote on the wall. The house's main attraction is the trippy <i>shroom room</i>, with mind-numbing geometric prints on the low ceiling and an interactive cloud fixture that changes color according to the mood and music. It also has colorful seating arrangements, and the Disney actress enjoys spending time with her friends here.</p><h2 id=the-immaculate-bedrooms-with-spacious-outdoors>The Immaculate Bedrooms With Spacious Outdoors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The primary bedroom has a curated Cleopatra chaise lounge and a pair of Beluga chairs that complement the bed platform. White paneled walls, a guitar on the big lounge, and a leopard sculpture complete the minimal look. The powder room is done up in Phantasia wallpaper of dragons and mushrooms. The tiger velvet ottoman in the main bathroom <a href=#>provides a very Zen-like atmosphere</a>. A deep white marble bathtub stands alone in the corner, and the space is flooded with ample natural light from the large windows.</p><p>Crystals inspire the studio set in the interior of the house. A rug from Cold Picnic, upholstered stitch stools, and executive chairs make the space a cozy haven to record songs. Designer Rob Rettberg conceptualized the aesthetics of this ice-cold tone room. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, the modern farmhouse also houses a contemporary gym, supersonic home theater, and a futuristic elevator. Her pet Yorkipoos has a private lounge with a netted play area. The patio is adorned with a glass table with a brass base and pink chairs near the pool. The outdoor entertainment area has a large swimming pool, a cabana lounge for sunbathing, a private screen to air outdoor movies in the summer, and a hot tub to soak in during the cold winter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The eclectic taste of the punk rockstar has been stamped in every corner of the house.
