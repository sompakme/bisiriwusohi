Some nutritionists are concerned about Cyrus' reasoning for no longer being vegan and the potential impact of her decision.

In fact, in 2015, speaking on The Tonight Show, Miley spoke about how she became vegan because of how intelligent fish were.</p><p>The singer had a pet blowfish that would swim to greet her every time she returned home. After it died, she got a tattoo with its image on her arm.</p><p>The Wrecking Ball singer is quick to point out that despite the dietary change, she still cares deeply about animals.</p><p>She's reminded fans that <strong>she has over 20 animals on her Nashville farm and 20 more at her Calabasas home.</strong></p><p>Cyrus told Rogan she was expecting anger from fans, but when it came to animals, her conscience is clear that she does the best for them, and will continue to do so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cyrus now describes herself as a Pescatarian, and her diet involves eating fish in addition to vegetables and plant-based foods.</p><p><strong>Cyrus added that since reincorporating fish and gluten-based products into her diet, she has found herself to be “much sharper,” and that many of her other health concerns have vanished</strong>.
