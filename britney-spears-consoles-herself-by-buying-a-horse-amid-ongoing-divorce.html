I can‚Äôt make up my mind !!! Should I join the camaraderie and put a pink cowboy hat on ??? Either way I think I found my sweet spot with Roar !!!" Britney continued.</p><p>The prices of horses vary greatly by the breed, but one estimate says it can <a href=#>cost between $1,500 to $60,000</a>, so Britney could be spending a small fortune, especially if she‚Äôs getting two.</p><p>Sam filed for divorce from Britney earlier this month following 14 months of marriage, citing ‚Äúirreconcilable differences.‚Äù In his filing, he requested spousal support and seemed to hint that he may be <a href=#>challenging the terms of their prenup.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>‚Äú[Sam] has yet to determine the full nature and extent of the separate property assets and obligations of each party,‚Äù <a href=#>court documents reveal, TMZ notes.</a></p><p>"There are various items of community and quasi-community assets and debts, the full nature and extent of which are unknown to [Sam] at this time,‚Äù the filing continued.</p><p>One report says that the prenup entitles Sam to $1 million for every two years of marriage, with a maximum of $10 million following 15 years together. The prenup also waived any potential rights Sam may have to her music catalog. The Iranian-born entertainer also isn‚Äôt listed on the mansion they currently call home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With their marriage lasting a little over a year, it‚Äôs unclear what the prenup entitles Sam to. But if it‚Äôs not a lot, it would explain why he‚Äôs reportedly gearing up to challenge it.</p><p>Amid the speculation, Sam has addressed his surprise divorce from Britney on social media, insisting there are no hurt feelings, at least on his end.</p><p>"AFTER 6 YEARS OF LOVE AND COMMITMENT TO EACH OTHER MY WIFE AND I HAVE DECIDED TO END OUR JOURNEY TOGETHER," <a href=#>he wrote via his Instagram Story.</a> "WE WILL HOLD ONTO THE LOVE AND RESPECT WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER AND I WISH HER THE BEST ALWAYS."</p><p>"S--- HAPPENS," Sam continued.
