Justin Bieber has been accused of handing out a gift at his birthday party that doubles a serious dig at ex Selena Gomez.
The “Yummy” singer — who turned 29 on Wednesday, March 1, and celebrated his birthday over the weekend — handed out silver lighters at the festivities that were engraved with a cryptic quote.
“I’m so thankful that I didn’t end up with what I thought I wanted,” the metal lighters read, as seen in a photo shared by Bieber’s close friend and music video director Alfredo Flores via social media."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Getting pettier every year,” another person<a href=#> penned</a>.</p><p>Still, others felt that the sentiment was positive — or that it held a different meaning.</p><p>“Can’t believe people are interpreting this negatively. justin is saying he’s grateful for the life he has as is,” <a href=#>said</a> one fan. “Or he could be talking about something else or his mental health. be fr. its been 10 years. let it go,” <a href=#>commented</a> another user.</p><p>The Grammy winner has been married to Hailey since 2018, but continues to be involved with drama surrounding the <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> star, 30, even five years after splitting for good following years of on-and-off relationship woes.</p><p>Gomez and Hailey, 26, raised eyebrows late last month when they appeared to be feuding via social media.</p><p>After the model and pal <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> </a>were accused by fans of<a href=#> making fun of the Golden Globe nominee’s eyebrows</a> via social media, the Kardashians star, 25, denied the rumors via TikTok on February 23. “No shade towards selena ever,” Jenner clarified at the time, which <a href=#>Gomez acknowledged</a>. “Agreed @kyliejenner It’s all unnecessary,” she replied to the Kylie Cosmetics mogul’s comment. “I’m a fan of Kylie!”</p><p>Hours later, however, the “Wolves” songstress didn’t hold back when commenting on a resurfaced video of Hailey gagging at the mention of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>“So sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game,” the Disney Channel alum wrote in response.</p><p>In addition to seemingly tossing his own hat in the ring amid the controversy, Justin also made a surprise appearance at the Rolling Loud music festival in Los Angeles on Saturday, March 5 — days after <a href=#>he seemingly canceled his remaining Justice World tour dates</a>.</p><p>The “Sorry” artist joined “Private Landing” collaborator<strong> Don Toliver</strong> on stage to perform their new track for the cheering crowd. Less than a week prior, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Ticketmaster marked all of Justin’s upcoming concerts in the U.S., Ireland, France, Poland, Australia, Denmark and the Czech Republic as canceled.</p><p>Though Justin and his team have yet to comment on the seemingly canceled dates, the “Ghost” singer announced in June 2022 that he would be postponing the tour amid <a href=#>his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt syndrome</a>, which can cause temporary facial paralysis.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This is pretty serious as you can see. I wish this wasn’t the case. But obviously, my body is telling me I need to slow down,” Justin shared in the Instagram video at the time, showing off <a href=#>the lack of movement in half of his face</a>.</p><p>“[He] has every faith this will resolve itself eventually, but of course, it’s a stressful situation to be dealing with and a tough time for both [him and Hailey] right now,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>at the time of Justin’s diagnosis. “The last thing he wanted was to postpone the concerts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iYsCmscyipaCkqWLAqa3Dnqpmq5Whsq%2BtjKCmpp2qYq61eceiqmaamafBqbDAsmSpmaKpxnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
