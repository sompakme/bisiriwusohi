But how exactly did Songz, who recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defended himself over sexual predator claims</a>, amass his fortune?</p><h2 id=how-does-trey-songz-make-money>How Does Trey Songz Make Money?</h2><p>Since the release his debut album in 2005, Trey Songz is credited on plenty of songs on his records, which was most notable on his 2009 record, Ready, where he wrote or co-wrote on every single track, including I Need A Girl and the hit song Say Aah featuring Fabolous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With eight albums under his belt, the father-of-one has sold more than 25 million records, so when you consider the fact that he also writes his music, there’s still to no doubt that the 35-year-old has made a fortune from songwriting royalties alone.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake’s ‘Baby Mama’s’ Transformation From A Former Adult Star To A Celebrated Artist</a></span></p><p>In 2010, Songz would release his biggest single yet; Bottoms Up featuring Nicki Minaj. The track quickly climbed up the charts and peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and also becoming the singer’s highest-charting single of his career.</p><p>In the United States alone, Bottoms Up went on to shift over four million copies and another two million worldwide.</p><p>Collaborating with Minaj certainly saw Songz’s career reach new heights, which also helped his fourth studio album, Passion, Pain & Pleasure find a comfortable spot at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 200, going on to sell over two million copies worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other notable songs that have done tremendously well for Songz include Mr. Steal Your Girl, Heart Attack, Touchin’ Lovin, Can’t Be Friends, and Simply Amazing, which, though it didn’t enter the Hot 100 in the US, surged to the No. 1 spot in the UK.</p><p>It’s fair to say that most of Songz’s income has come from royalties, album sales, and songwriting credits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Does Drake Have Regrets About His Time On ‘Degrassi’?</a></span></p><p>In 2014, following the release of his sixth studio album, Trigga, Songz renewed his deal with Atlantic Records, and while the exact numbers were never disclosed, given the success he’s had with the label for almost a decade, it’s assumed that the offer would’ve certainly been lucrative.</p><p>"Just happy to be here and I'm happy for us to starting a new chapter together," the R&B singer said in a YouTube video after signing his new deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We've learned a lot together, so much more we will experience together, these will be the greatest years of what we've started to build together. I'm excited, let's go."</p><p>In 2017, Songz dropped his most recent album, titled Tremaine The Album, which featured the songs Nobody Else But You, Playboy, and Song Goes Off.</p><p>Unlike his predecessor, the record didn’t produce buzz-worthy singles yet still managed to land at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 200 and sold over 500,000 copies in the US.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj Fans Are Furious After Celeb ‘Side-Chick’ Celina Powell Reveals Her Baby’s Gender</a></span></p><h2 id=where-else-does-trey-songz-make-money>Where Else Does Trey Songz Make Money?</h2><p>Aside from music, Trey Songz has also built up an impressive list of credentials as far as his acting career his concerned.</p><p>In 2013, he starred alongside Paula Patton, Jennifer Lewis, and Boris Kodjoe in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">well-received comedy flick Baggage Claim</a>; the same year he also made an appearance in the John Luessenhop-directed horror Texas Chainsaw, which grossed close to $50 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And with over 12 million followers on Instagram, it’s believed that Songz can command up to $25,000 for every sponsored post he decides to promote with his platform.
