According to the actress, she had to tap into some deep trauma, which included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her mother trying to hold it together at a young age</a> when she had separated from her father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Larson recalls the moment, "I was reminded of my childhood when I was seven and my mom packed up our old Mercedes and we drove from Sacramento to Los Angeles, about six hours, because I wanted to be an actor. We moved into a studio, about twice the size of the room in Room."</p><p>She continues, "We had a bed that came out of the wall and we lived on noodles and had a couple of McDonald’s toys. I thought we were living the dream! But I remember being woken up by my mom sobbing, and it was only years later I realized that she also moved us out there because she was going through a divorce. She was struggling."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Drew Barrymore Asked For Emancipation From Her Parents At Age 14</a></span></p><p>Larson would go on to reveal that she truly realized the difficulties of being a mom while shooting the film.

"As a kid I tried to understand him and understand the situation. But he didn't do himself any favors. I don't think he ever really wanted to be a parent.
