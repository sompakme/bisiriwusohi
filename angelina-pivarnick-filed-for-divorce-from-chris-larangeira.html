I love u guys.”</p><p>“Angelina and Chris have always had<a href=#> a contentious relationship</a>,” a source exclusively told Us in November 2020 amid breakup speculation. “She and him are very involved but they butt heads very often, you never know if they’re going to be in a good place or upset with each other.”</p><p>Four months prior, the reality star <a href=#>showed off her new boob job</a>, telling her fans “my boobies are my fave part of my body now.” Pivarnick’s February cosmetic procedure came three months after the <a href=#>MTV personality married Larangeira</a> in November 2019.</p><p>The pair’s wedding caused a fallout between Pivarnick and her <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> costars <a href=#><strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Deena Nicole Cortese</strong></a>, who made <a href=#>jokes about the bride</a> during her reception.</p><p>“I live day by day, so I’m going to try to forget about the past,” the Couples Therapy alum <a href=#>told Us in December 2019</a>, alluding to the wedding drama. “My thing is, I forgive too many people too quickly. I’m going to stop doing that, so for 2020, that’s also a new thing. I’m going to keep my circle way smaller, you know? I think right now, all I need is my husband and my family and his family.”</p><p>When the controversial toast played out on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, Pivarnick revealed on social media that it was still painful for her and Larangeira to watch.</p><p>“My husband was distraught and I was acting like I was okay with this,” she tweeted at the time. “I saw his face and I snapped because I know my husband and I know the look in his eyes. I just couldn’t hold it back anymore. I was also mad don’t get it twisted.”</p><p>The pair said “I do” nearly two years after <a href=#>getting engaged in January 2018</a>. The couple had been dating for one year when the sanitation worker popped the question after enjoying a “beautiful Italian dinner,” a source told Us at the time.</p><p>“I followed a trail of rose petals all the way to his bed,” Pivarnick told Us of the proposal. “He proposed and then we laid in the roses.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly&nbsp;has reached out to both parties for comment.</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeauaq6wGanoq6Rp7uqr8pmnaKklZl6p7vRZpuirp%2BnsKZ5xaumpmWTnb%2Bqv4ylmKuZnpyyqr7AaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
