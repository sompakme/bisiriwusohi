Our Depop queen always pushes the boundaries with her looks, styling unexpected pieces together and always throwing her favorite Y2K aesthetic in the mix. Her big sister goes for a more modern look and is a bit more trend-focused. Well, the contrast has never been more on display than when the duo attended the US Open together on Wednesday night.</p><p><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kin Euphorics partner channeled the sporty theme of the evening in a casual athleisure outfit. She wore a white zip-up track jacket with a mock turtleneck and a low-rise khaki skirt that hit just above her knees, accented by chunky brown-and-tan sneakers. For shoes, she opted for mid-calf white socks and black sunglasses.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gigi took a more colorful route, wearing a vibrant all-red set by Simon Miller.

"My brother is half and half. Whatever the family dinner-table discussion is, Bella will be very emotional and compassionate, and I'm sitting there pulling up charts and infographics, speaking very calmly. My mom is just very Dutch and to the point.
