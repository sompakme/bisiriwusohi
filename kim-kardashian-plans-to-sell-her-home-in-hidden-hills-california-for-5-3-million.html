The reality television star and billionaire e-commerce mogul has listed another one of her multiple properties. The Hidden Hills mansion is asking $5.3 million for the ranch house next to it, which she purchased in 2006 for $5.5 million.</p><p>Kim Kardashian purchased the house for just $1.6 million in October 2019, back when she was still married to rapper, record producer and fashion designer Kanye West, the fixer upper was built back in the late 1950s and appears to have been left largely untouched during her relatively short ownership.</p><p>On a hillside in Hidden Hills, the property rests on an approximately 1.5-acre parcel bisected by a street that’s open to the public. The main residence has four bedrooms and four baths in nearly 4,000 square feet of living space. Across the street from that house is an equestrian facility encompassing a four-stall barn, corral, and storage space for feed and equipment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Kim Kardashian And Kris Jenner Enters The Industry Of Business Venture</b></a></span></p><p>The current listing doesn't include any interior photos of the main house, but older listings show a white wood-shingled structure with a kitchen accented by a center island, granite countertops and stainless appliances.

She also lays claim to a big vacant lot in Madison Club’s Hancock Park neighborhood, where several of her family members own vacation homes.</p><p>In an interview with Vogue, Kardashian said her mother and "momager," Kris Jenner, originally convinced her to purchase the property after Jenner, 66, bought a place in the same building.</p><p>The listing is held by Tomer Fridman of Compass.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Real-Time Billionaire Elon Musk’s Ex-Girlfriend Puts Old Memories Together (Photos, Gifts) Up For Auction</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo3qxuMCnqmasn2LAprjLZp%2Beql2dvK6xjKKlZqCZmbGmuoyhoKWko2KworjIn6arppmWeqe70WZsZmtdoratuMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
