Khoshbin is often spotted driving the car down canyon roads or posting videos of its speed and design on social media. Based on the latest generation of 911, he believes that it is the best car money can buy.</p><h2 id=pagani-huayra-herm-s-edition-5-million>Pagani Huayra Hermès Edition ($5 million)</h2><p>In another collaboration with Hermès, Khoshbin contacted Pagani to create a car designed by his favorite designer, and the automaker complied. The dark brown vehicle was given a refreshing interior and stocked with a V-12 twin-turbo engine sourced by AMG, as noted by <a href=#>Motor 1</a>. Each interior item was custom-made in Paris by Hermès.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolls-royce-phantom-drophead-445-000>Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead ($445,000)</h2><p>The Phantom is a unique white-on-white car from Rolls Royce in the collection. In the family car, Khoshbin is often photographed in the car with his wife and children. The Phantom Drophead has only clocked 5,400 miles. It comes with a V-12 engine and eight-speed automatic transmission that prances to a top speed of 155 MPH.</p><h2 id=rolls-royce-dawn-356-500>Rolls Royce Dawn ($356,500)</h2><p>Another Rolls Royce in the midst, the Dawn, is a stunning convertible in Manny’s collection, often used by his family.

The mogul’s favorite setting is the unique V-Max mode exclusive to the edition, as reported by <a href=#>Auto Evolution</a>. He has claimed that the Ken Miles tribute edition is the best-sounding V6-powered car in his garage.</p><h2 id=mercedes-slr-amg-mclaren-740-000>Mercedes SLR AMG McLaren ($740,000)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Owning not one or two but eight whopping Mercedes SLR AMG McLaren, Manny Khoshbin has always been a fan of the German-British hybrid. His latest purchase occurred in 2021 when he bought two SLR AMG McLaren models simultaneously: one with a silver exterior and red interior and the other with an all-black interior and exterior.</p><h2 id=ferrari-daytona-sp3-2-2-million>Ferrari Daytona SP3 ($2.2 million)</h2><p><a href=#>When Ferrari announced its Daytona SP3 model</a>, gearheads worldwide went crazy to get their hands on the supercar, and Manny Khoshbin wasn’t far behind. While he once had a fallout with Ferrari due to a dispute, he was willing to start a new relationship with the automaker through the 828 HP-powered Daytona SP3. The mogul has previously owned a Ferrari 360 Spider and F40.</p><h2 id=custom-carbon-black-mclaren-p1-1-1-million>Custom Carbon Black McLaren P1 ($1.1 million)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While all McLaren P1s are made from carbon fiber, it is only limited to the body panels. In 2014, McLaren released 20 limited edition hypercars with carbon fiber everywhere. As mentioned by <a href=#>Yahoo</a>, when Khoshbin first purchased the car in 2012, McLaren declined to offer customization. However, once the full-body carbon package was announced, he became one of the 20 lucky people to get the car.</p><p>Other notable cars in Manny Khoshbin’s garage include the Tesla Model X, Porsche 935, Rolls Royce Ghost, McLaren Speedtail, McLaren Senna, and many more. Manny Khoshbin will continue to flourish his collection with more customized stunning supercars as a car enthusiast with a sprawling net worth.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside T-Pain's Ultra Luxurious Garage</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car and Driver</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motor 1</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Auto Evolution</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaqlZa5brHSrZitnV2ivKjBy6xknJmiYrCwuMuemq2hn6N6qrrSopueZZ2Wu6%2FFjKSfqKuYl7avv4ycqZqyqWKyubzEp6qirpVitKK%2BwKCcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
