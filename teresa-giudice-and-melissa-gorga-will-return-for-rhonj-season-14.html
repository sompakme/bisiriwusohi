The rest of the cast — <a href=#><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Margaret Josephs</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aydin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Danielle Cabral</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rachel Fuda</strong></a> — is also expected to return.</p><p>Earlier this year, Melissa said she had <a href=#>no plans to exit</a>&nbsp;RHONJ amid rumors that production for season 14 was put on pause due to her and husband <a href=#><strong>Joe Gorga</strong></a>’s drama with Teresa.</p><p>“Our family has been through ups and downs for so many years on this show,” Melissa, who has been <a href=#>married to Joe</a>, 43, for more than 19 years, explained during a May episode of her “<a href=#>On Display with Melissa Gorga</a>” podcast. “I have never left before and I have no intentions on leaving now.”</p><p>As rumors about season 14 continued to swirl, <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> revealed in his book <a href=#>The Daddy Diaries</a>&nbsp;that the feud between the RHONJ families was the reason the <a href=#>BravoCon</a> 2022 panel had to be split in two. Cohen, 55, shared that Teresa <a href=#>called him and told him</a> that she would never speak to her brother and sister-in-law again. Melissa, for her part, allegedly sent the Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen host a 2,000-word text at the convention detailing a fight she and Joe had with costar Jennifer, 46.</p><p>The tension between the sisters-in-law began when Teresa claimed that Melissa cheated on Joe during a business trip. The accusations led <a href=#>the Gorgas to skip</a> Teresa’s <a href=#>August 2022 wedding</a> to her now-husband, <a href=#><strong>Luis “Louie” Ruelas</strong></a>. The <a href=#>couple’s nuptials</a> — and the <a href=#>drama behind the scenes</a> — were filmed for the Bravo special Teresa Gets Married, which aired in late May.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During the <a href=#>season 13 finale of RHONJ</a>, which aired last month, Melissa called Teresa a “f—ked-up sister-in-law” for allegedly spreading “the baseless rumor,” claiming that Teresa&nbsp;“feeds on us getting a divorce.”</p><p>Teresa retaliated and accused Melissa of <a href=#>tipping off authorities</a> when she and ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Joe Giudice</strong></a> were <a href=#>convicted of tax fraud</a> in 2014. Teresa went on to <a href=#>serve an 11-month prison sentence</a> in 2015. Melissa, meanwhile, claimed that her husband couldn’t visit Teresa behind bars because she didn’t put Joe Gorga’s name on her visitor list until it was time to film Teresa Checks In — the 2015 Bravo special about her <a href=#>prison experience</a>. Teresa, for her part, denied the claims.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKueqpWorm6zyK6bopuVYq6vsIymnKWho6iubrPOq56aZaeeua150Z6rrqqeYrOwvoyrn6immmLApq3SqKVmaWRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
