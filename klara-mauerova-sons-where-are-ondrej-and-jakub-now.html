She is known as the Kurim Cannibal mother.</p><p>The cannibal mother was always inclined to mysticism. It is the belief that one can be united with God or transform into a diety through contemplation or self-surrender.</p><p>Mystic refers to the binding of the soul to something sacred while still living on the earth. It is mainly known to occur in monotheistic religions.</p><p>The Czech national was suffering from schizophrenia from an early age. This is supposed to be the cause of her hardwired beliefs.</p><p>Furthermore, her sister Katherine also holds the same idea and beliefs. They used to study at the same University.</p><p>Barbora met Klara while studying Pedagogy at a University. Barbora looked like a young girl in her 30s. She was originally suffering from hypopituitarism.</p><p>The hypopituitarism patient used the disease to her advantage and tricked people into treating her as a child.</p><p>All three of them joined the religious sect which was led by a person called The Doctor. He directed them towards cannibalism, sexual promiscuity, and incest.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=klara-mauerova-sons-where-are-ondrej-and-jakub></span>Klara Mauerova Sons:&nbsp;Where are Ondrej and Jakub?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ondrej and Jakub are the two son of Klara Mauerova. They fell victim to the crimes committed by their mother and aunt. They were later adopted by an American family.</p><p>Jakub and Ondrej used to get scolding for actions that were deliberately caused by Barbora. She was the one who suggested that three of them join the religious sect.</p><p>The two of them were put inside the cage and tortured in the basement. They often used to sleep naked surrounded by their own feces.</p><p>The brother had scars of burn marks from cigarettes all over their limbs. They also had to bathe in cold water during the winter.</p><p>Klara also had his children skinned to practice cannibalism. The torture continued for a year until May 2007. One of the neighbors caught their act on the CCTV and reported it to the police.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-klara-mauerova-her-age></span>How old is Klara Mauerova? Her Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Klara Mauerova is at the age of 46 years old now. She was born in 1975 in Czechoslovakia.</p><p>Klara met her husband who is a lot older than her while she was studying. She left her home and went on to make family and children with him.</p><p>Klara’s spouse left her reportedly due to family violence from Mauerova. Klara started raising her kids on her own. Later Katherine joined her sister to look after the family.</p><p>Klara was sentenced to 9 years in prison. Her sister was sentenced to 10 years while Barbora only got 5 years of imprisonment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOclr%2BiecyarJ6qn6uubr%2FOp6pmr5iav6Z5wKucZqeemb%2BmtoyapZ1lmpa4tq6Mp6awZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
