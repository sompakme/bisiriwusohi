The star quickly caught wind of the comment and defended her choice to work with upcoming artists, recalling the chapter of her career when artists “acted too big” for her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Y’all be getting besides y’all self,” she wrote. She also explained she connected with Anycia because they’re from the same region. “Shawty from the south side & she hard af Idc bout allat.
