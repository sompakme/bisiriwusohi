Two spacecraft took off from&nbsp;opposite ends of&nbsp;the earth&nbsp;— the&nbsp;Kennedy Space Center in&nbsp;Florida and&nbsp;the ultra-secret Soviet cosmodrome in&nbsp;Baikonur, Kazakhstan.</p><p>Two days later, on&nbsp;July 17, the&nbsp;American Apollo spacecraft, commanded by&nbsp;legendary astronaut General Thomas Stafford, met its Soviet Soyuz counterpart, commanded by&nbsp;cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, high above the&nbsp;Elbe River in&nbsp;Germany.</p><p>It was the&nbsp;first time the&nbsp;two Cold War space programs joined in&nbsp;common cause, putting an&nbsp;end to&nbsp;the space race and&nbsp;ushering in&nbsp;a new era of&nbsp;outer space cooperation that lives on&nbsp;today in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;the ISS.</p><p>"The legacy of&nbsp;Apollo-Soyuz is the&nbsp;foundation [it laid]," General Stafford told The&nbsp;Moscow Times on&nbsp;Wednesday at&nbsp;a celebration of&nbsp;the 40th anniversary of&nbsp;the historic mission, which was known as the&nbsp;"handshake in&nbsp;space."</p><p>Stafford said it demonstrated "that two countries, the&nbsp;two superpowers in&nbsp;the world, with different languages, different systems of&nbsp;measurement, and&nbsp;two different political systems could work together for&nbsp;a common goal and&nbsp;do it successfully, [thereby laying] the&nbsp;foundation for&nbsp;future work in&nbsp;space."</p><h2>For All Mankind</h2><p>Almost 20 years after the&nbsp;launch of&nbsp;the Sputnik satellite by&nbsp;the Soviet Union in&nbsp;1957 sparked the&nbsp;Cold War space race, the&nbsp;era of&nbsp;competition between NASA and&nbsp;the ultra-secret Soviet space program was drawing to&nbsp;an end.</p><p>In&nbsp;1972, NASA's Apollo moon program ended after President Richard Nixon canceled the&nbsp;final two planned missions. Spacecraft had already been built, however, and&nbsp;the agency needed something to&nbsp;do with its surplus Apollo modules.</p><p>In&nbsp;the spirit of&nbsp;detente&nbsp;— a&nbsp;policy spearheaded by&nbsp;Nixon and&nbsp;Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in&nbsp;the early 1970s&nbsp;— the&nbsp;U.S. president proposed using one of&nbsp;the Apollo ships in&nbsp;a cooperative space project with the&nbsp;U.S.S.R. as a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;easing tensions between the&nbsp;superpowers.</p><p>The&nbsp;two ships, which represented the&nbsp;cumulative work of&nbsp;two completely different space programs and&nbsp;space technologies, met in&nbsp;space and&nbsp;docked over the&nbsp;Elbe River, where 30 years earlier U.S. and&nbsp;Soviet forces converged during their push into&nbsp;Nazi Germany.</p><p>"We were supposed to&nbsp;open the&nbsp;hatches and&nbsp;shake hands over Moscow, but it happened over the&nbsp;Elbe because we were 20 minutes ahead of&nbsp;schedule," said General Alexei Leonov, the&nbsp;Russian cosmonaut who commanded the&nbsp;Soviet Soyuz half of&nbsp;the mission.</p><p>"Imagine that. In&nbsp;1945 our fathers met on&nbsp;the Elbe, and&nbsp;in 1975 their sons met over [it]," Leonov said during the&nbsp;celebrations at&nbsp;Moscow's Museum of&nbsp;Cosmonautics on&nbsp;Wednesday.</p><p></p><h2>Lasting Friendship</h2><p>The&nbsp;legacy of&nbsp;the Apollo-Soyuz mission lives on&nbsp;today, forming the&nbsp;foundation of&nbsp;modern U.S.-Russia space cooperation. The&nbsp;institutional format of&nbsp;joint mission planning and&nbsp;cooperative astronaut training at&nbsp;facilities across the&nbsp;globe was pioneered in&nbsp;the three years leading up to&nbsp;the mission.</p><p>"The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project was an&nbsp;indispensable technical precursor of&nbsp;the [U.S.-Russia] Shuttle-Mir Program in&nbsp;the 1990s, and&nbsp;the current International Space Station program," said U.S. Ambassador to&nbsp;Russia John Tefft at&nbsp;the ceremony.</p><p>"The U.S. and&nbsp;Russia are still using significant engineering achievements of&nbsp;that joint project. From&nbsp;a human standpoint, it is highly notable that the&nbsp;two commanders, Tom Stafford and&nbsp;Alexei Leonov, have become close friends and&nbsp;have maintained their friendship all these years," Tefft added.</p><p>Stafford and&nbsp;Leonov were both legends in&nbsp;their home countries for&nbsp;their exploits during the&nbsp;space race.</p><p>Leonov gained world fame in&nbsp;1965 when he became the&nbsp;first man to&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;space during the&nbsp;Soviet Voskhod 2 mission. Stafford was a&nbsp;veteran of&nbsp;two spaceflights during NASA's Gemini program and&nbsp;a flight to&nbsp;the moon on&nbsp;Apollo 10 to&nbsp;test the&nbsp;lunar lander vehicle before Neil Armstrong's Apollo 11 mission.</p><p>For&nbsp;Apollo-Soyuz, the&nbsp;two learned each other's languages. Leonov spoke in&nbsp;English during the&nbsp;mission and&nbsp;Stafford spoke Russian&nbsp;— though with a&nbsp;heavy Oklahoma drawl. They quickly bonded as a&nbsp;crew, Leonov said during a&nbsp;press conference on&nbsp;Wednesday, and&nbsp;took to&nbsp;playing jokes on&nbsp;each other.</p><p>Leonov told a&nbsp;story from&nbsp;the mission in&nbsp;which he presented Stafford and&nbsp;the American crew with a&nbsp;tube allegedly containing Stolichnaya vodka, insisting the&nbsp;astronauts drink it&nbsp;— as was Russian tradition. The&nbsp;U.S. crew politely refused, citing NASA regulations, but eventually the&nbsp;tubes were opened and&nbsp;discovered to&nbsp;contain only borscht. Leonov put the&nbsp;vodka label on&nbsp;as a&nbsp;joke.</p><p>So began a&nbsp;friendship that has lasted decades. "We keep in&nbsp;touch," Stafford said, "I talk to&nbsp;him every two or three weeks by&nbsp;telephone and&nbsp;we see each other two or three times a&nbsp;year. We hunt birds together, we hunt elk together."</p><p>Leonov was also instrumental in&nbsp;helping Stafford adopt two Russian boys, the&nbsp;astronaut said.</p><p>"I never knew when I flew on&nbsp;Apollo-Soyuz that 27 years later I would adopt two Russian orphan boys, but he helped me and&nbsp;he was my character witness in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the judge when my wife and&nbsp;I adopted them. So he helped me a&nbsp;lot, he helped me pick out the&nbsp;two boys. They are both wonderful sons."</p><p>One of&nbsp;Stafford's Russian sons, Stas, is currently a&nbsp;cadet at&nbsp;the U.S. Military Academy at&nbsp;West Point, a&nbsp;true sign that the&nbsp;Apollo-Soyuz mission bridged worlds separated by&nbsp;seemingly insurmountable political and&nbsp;cultural barriers.</p><p>Responding to&nbsp;a question about current tensions between the&nbsp;U.S. and&nbsp;Russia and&nbsp;their possible impact on&nbsp;the ISS program, Stafford said that "the tensions today are nothing compared to&nbsp;the tensions we had during the&nbsp;height of&nbsp;the Cold War."</p><p>"It never affected us working in&nbsp;space together," he concluded," and&nbsp;it doesn't affect what is going on&nbsp;aboard the&nbsp;International Space Station."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpqasm5%2Bswaq5xKxlnKedZH9xfZRoZ3BnYWt8s8HSrKCapl2Wu6V51KxkrKiRmLJuuMSgnKeco2K6prHTZmtpZamarrO%2FjJqdrZ2iYrWiusOsn5qjlWK2r3nSqZicnV2rtqWxzmaYbXBiZ4E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
