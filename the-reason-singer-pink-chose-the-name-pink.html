But from the moment fans were introduced to her in the '90s, they've known her as Pink. So how did she come up with the name Pink (stylized as P!nk on her albums)? It's kind of a long story.</p><p>Pink has been in the industry since she was a teen. She actually started out as part of a three-person girl band but was later offered the opportunity to strike out solo.</p><p>And despite some dips and plateaus in her career, Pink continued an upward trajectory that she's still riding on today.</p><p>The singer has been open about everything from her thoughts on politics to her struggles in her marriage. Pink shares a lot about herself, and she's recently revealed even more. Including how she came up with her stage name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pink-s-extremely-honest-thoughts-on-her-most-popular-and-divisive-songs-creative-commons-licenes.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Pink Didn't Hold Back When Addressing Her Most Popular And Divisive Songs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pink didn't hold back when addressing the controversies surrounding her music.</span><p><strong>Updated March 2024:</strong> In 2023, Pink released her latest album, 'Trustfall'. It was critically well-received and debuted at Number Two on the Billboard charts. Pink is on tour for the album in the early part of 2024 in Australia and the UK and in the US at the end of the year.</p><h2 id=pink-was-what-she-went-by-even-when-she-was-part-of-a-girl-band>Pink Was What She Went By, Even When She Was Part Of A Girl Band</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar49390242-1.jpg><p>Even when she was part of a teen girl group, Pink was already going by her name. So, it wasn't a record executive's decision to slap a new moniker on her.</p><p>In fact, <strong>the singer had the stage name when she first performed at about 14 years old</strong>. As multiple sources have revealed, a young Alecia was taunted with the name before she made it her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After releasing her album M!ssundaztood, Pink explained how she came up with the name that would become famous with her: <strong>"It's just a nickname that's been following me my whole life. It was a mean thing at first; some kids at camp pulled my pants down and I blushed so much, and they were like, 'Ha ha! Look at her! She's pink!'"</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-26t105944-630.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Pink Stopped During Her Concert To Kick Out A Fan With A Disturbing Sign</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A protester showed up to Pink's concert for all the wrong reasons, trying to spread a message with his sign.</span><p>Then, the movie Reservoir Dogs came out, and the singer realized the character Mr. Pink was someone she wouldn't mind being associated with.</p><p>After that, <strong>Pink</strong> became a lot more than just her nickname. It became an identity she could (and wanted to) work with. As LiveAbout recapped, most of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pink's early albums played off her feelings of insecurity</a> and needing to live up to society's standards for a pop star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar49189270-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From "Don't Let Me Get Me," which was about not wanting to conform to being marketed like Britney Spears, to "Sober" about getting past her need to drink to be socially accepted, Pink evidently pours her emotions into her music.</p><p>Not only does her name buck trends (while also being at odds with her iconic bad-girl appearance), but her songs spoke to fans in a way that has endured over the years.</p><p>As of 2024, Pink is on tour for her latest album, Trustfall. She is touring first through Australia and the UK before she makes appearances in the US in the latter part of 2024.</p><p>Source: Hollywood, LiveAbout</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpbavt4ycn6irlWK7ornEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
