It’s not mine or anyone else’s.”</p><p>The actress famously played Rudy on the iconic series The Cosby Show from 1984 to 1992. She went on to star in films like Beauty Shop and Tyler Perry’s Madea Goes to Jail.</p><p>Day one of Cosby’s trial took place at Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa. Monday (June 5) with the 38-year-old seen by reporters escorting the 79-year-old comedian into the building. Cosby is facing up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple University employee, Andrea Constand. Knight Pulliam, who has a foundation supporting the wellness of young girls, stated she wasn’t a supporter of the alleged crimes, but believes the trial should be viewed from an objective point of view.</p><p>“I don’t condone sexual assault in any way, shape or form, but, at the end of the day, our court system is set up … you’re innocent until proven guilty,” the actress said. “The job now is for the two sides to prove their cases, and I accept whatever verdict is handed down.”</p><p>Cosby shared his appreciation for his TV daughter on Twitter.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you to Cliff and Claire's 4 year old daughter (Rudy) and the Brilliant Spelman Alumnus<a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheCosbyShow</a><a href=# rel=nofollow>#KeshiaKnightPulliam</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/5Ax9OiCjPV</a></p><p>— Bill Cosby (@BillCosby) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 5, 2017</a></p><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>#TheCosbyShow</a><a href=# rel=nofollow>#KeishaKnightPulliam</a><a href=# rel=nofollow>#CameToCourtToHearTheTruth</a></p><p>— Bill Cosby (@BillCosby) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 5, 2017</a></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>On Tuesday (June 6), Cosby arrived with his spokesman by his side. Constand also made her first appearance since her 2004 case against the comedian was brought back into the public eye.&nbsp;Kelly Johnson was the first to testify Monday and explained how she was assaulted by Cosby in 1996. Johnson and her mother&nbsp;Dr. Patrice Sewell testified that Cosby tried to get her fired from the William Morris talent agency after the alleged assault happened. “She was distraught… because of the conversation that she had heard and she thought that both Mr. Cosby and Tom Illius [Cosby’s agent] or Mr. Cosby was setting her up in some kind of way.”</p><p>With Constand taking the stand today, Cosby’s defense plans to explain their sexual contact was consensual.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: 06/14/2017 2:00 P.M. EST</strong></p><p>Knight-Pulliam has defended her presence at Cosby’s trial once again. On Wednesday (June 14), the actress and former Cosby Show star appeared on the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Today</a> show to share her thoughts on her TV dad.</p><p>“It was important for me to be there because at the end of the day, I believe you’re innocent until proven guilty. And that’s not the man that I ever experienced,” she said. “And I thought about it, how would I want to be treated if I was in that situation? And the true test of family, of friendship, of loyalty comes [at that moment]. It’s easier to be there for someone when business is good, when money is good, all these things.’I just felt like I wanted to do what I would have wanted to receive.”</p><p>She also shared her thoughts on his state of mind during the trial. “I can’t speak to this exact moment, but my interactions with him, he’s been in good spirits. He’s been upbeat,” she said. “Knowing Mr. Cosby is to know, he’s a comedian. There’s that sense of laughter. And I was grateful to see his spirit hadn’t been broken as a result of this process.”</p><p>The defense for the trial rested Tuesday (June 12), with the outcome now in the hands of the jury. If convicted for the&nbsp;three counts of aggravated indecent assault, the 79-year-old can face up to 30 years in jail.</p><p>Watch Pulliam-Knight’s interview below.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.today.com/offsite/bill-cosby-s-co-star-keshia-knight-pulliam-his-spirit-hasn-t-been-broken-967074371653</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Cyqr%2FHmmSkppmctbV5z66jpaGRonqmxM%2BlmKKmo2K9s7HSnqWcnV2Xtq24jJymrJqpqHq0sdeumKVlkajAosHLrWStqpmWuW6BkG9waWhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
