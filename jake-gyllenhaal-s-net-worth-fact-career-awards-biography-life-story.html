Actor Ryan Reynolds is usually the one making the jokes, but last night fellow stars Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal turned the tables on him. Reynolds attended a party with the other two actors, who apparently told him it was a Christmas sweater party. Reynolds showed up in a red and green sweater with a giant gaudy gold bow on it. The photo Reynolds posted to his Instagram Thursday night says it all, with the “Deadpool” actor looking very unamused, standing between Jackman and Gyllenhaal who are dressed quite normally and clearly enjoying themselves at Reynolds expense. Reynolds revealed on social media Friday his fellow actors pulled a holiday prank on him.</p><p>Imported snow from Holland was among the secret weapons deployed by <b>Everest</b> director Baltasar Kormakur in his quest to make his 3D film about the disastrous 1996 expedition, when eight climbers died on the world’s highest mountain, as realistic as possible.&nbsp;The film crew also filmed in the Dolomite mountains, on the Italian-Austrian border, and added visual effects to blend in shots of the actual Himalayas. While stressing that no one was exposed to any unnecessary danger, he said the film benefited from sending a film unit headed by renowned mountain film-making specialist David Breashears to the summit two years before photography got underway. During a subsequent Everest ascent, the second unit was caught up in the 2014 avalanche (in which 16 Sherpas died). None of the film crew were harmed. “There’s a difference between pain and injury,” said Kormakur. “I put them through a lot of pain, but no injury.”</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-of-jake></span>Early Life of Jake<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jake Gyllenhaal was born on 19th December 1980, in Los Angeles, California, the USA with the birth name of Jacob Benjamin Gyllenhaal.
