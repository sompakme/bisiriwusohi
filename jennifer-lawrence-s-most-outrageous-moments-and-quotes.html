From puking in front of <a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> to photobombing <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, leave it to the Oscar winner to make headlines for her many outrageous moments and equally entertaining quotes.</p><p>The X-Men: Dark Phoenix star, who got engaged to <a href=#><strong>Cooke Maroney</strong></a> in February 2019, <a href=#>wasn’t afraid to open up about the difficult parts of planning her wedding</a>.</p><p>“Yesterday was my only bridezilla moment where I cried because I thought I didn’t want to have a bachelorette party, then last minute I decided I did,” Lawrence mentioned during an episode of the “Naked with Catt Sadler” podcast in June 2019. “Then nobody was available because it was last minute. Then I started crying. I was like, ‘I don’t even know why I’m crying. I didn’t know that I wanted a bachelorette party. I guess I just feel pathetic.’”</p><p>The following year, Lawrence made headlines<a href=#> for discussing how she changed her politics “based on the things” she learned over the years</a>.</p><p>“My first time voting, I voted for <a href=#>John McCain</a>. I was a little Republican,” the actress mentioned during the “Absolutely Not” podcast in October 2020.</p><p>Lawrence noted that even though she agreed with “the fiscal benefits of the Republican policies,” she couldn’t help <a href=#>but see that “the social issues weren’t in line” with her views</a>.</p><p>The Joy actress added that for her there was “a line drawn in the sand” after <a href=#><strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> got elected in 2016. After her comments made headlines, Lawrence took to social media to explain the point that she was trying to make.</p><p>“I would like to clarify my voting record, which is the subject of many circulating headlines,” she tweeted at the time. “I grew up in a Republican family and voted for John McCain in 2008, but through <a href=#><strong>[Barack] Obama</strong></a>‘s presidency, and growing up to realize I was voting against my own rights, I am proud to say I am a Democrat.”</p><p>During the “Absolutely Not” podcast, Lawrence continued to not hold back and even addressed <a href=#>her viral fall during the 85th annual Academy Awards</a>. For the Silver Linings Playbook star, having <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a> call it intentional was very upsetting.</p><p>“I saw him on CNN three days [after the Oscars] saying, ‘Well, she obviously faked the fall,'” she shared in October 2020. “It was so devastating because it was this horrific humiliation to me. I don’t know if I’ll ever have a chance to give a speech like that again, so it didn’t feel good for me not to have a speech.”</p><p>The American Hustle star <a href=#>detailed how she later confronted Cooper at a holiday party to “let him know” how she felt</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My friend told me a vein was bulging out of my eyes. He apologized. I think we’re good friends now,” Lawrence said. “On my end, we’re all good. What I led with was, ‘Have you ever tried to walk up stairs in a ball gown? So then how do you know?’ He apologized immediately and said he didn’t know and gave this wonderful apology. I was all fired up … He probably told everyone I was a psycho.”</p><p>Scroll down to revisit all of Lawrence’s most iconic moment!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bfsq%2B6yJ%2Bcq2WclsSzsc2cnGaln6jBbrnEpqarmZKhsm5%2Bj2prZpmnlr%2Blv4ysnJqrn6N6rrvMnqWtq11nfXKAkW1paA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
