She added that this is only a tactic Dillon is using to delay their official divorce so he can continue to profit over his association to Joe.</p><p>The attorney goes further to allege that Dillon has sold some of Joe’s personal items for profit since the Netflix documentary star has been behind bars. She says Dillon has made over $1 million in profits sicne the documentary aired.</p><p>Despite Joe’s recent fame, the court documents reveal that both he and his ex-husband are in a significant amount of debt. While Joe has $65,000 in assets, his debts are over $100,052,000. The documents reveal his annual income is $7,800.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dillon isn’t in a much better position. The documents show he has a net worth of $20,100 but $20,000 in student debt. He reportedly only has $100 in his bank account.</p><p>Dillon’s attorney Parastoo Majd gave a brief statement following the filing. He implied the exes did sign a legal agreement and said he’d be providing more information at a later time.</p><p>" <a href=#>The prenuptial agreement was entered</a> into legally by both parties and I will have a full statement after the holiday weekend,” the lawyer said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe and Dillon married in 2017, only two months after Joe’s last husband Travis Maldonado died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. However, it was confirmed in March that Joe was seeking a divorce while in prison.</p><p>"Mr. Maldonado-Passage is seeking a divorce from jail because he desires to marry his new love interest, Mr. John Graham whom he met in prison,” his lawyer stated at the time.</p><p>She added that Joe and Dillon had split the following year before he met his current fiancé, despite still being legally married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joe’s fiancé has been released since prison since they met but the pair are planning a lavish celebration, for a prison wedding that is. Joe has reportedly commissioned Odain Watson of L.A. streetwear brand Odaingerous to <a href=#>create custom outfits for him and his groom</a>. The all-white tuxes will reportedly cost around $11,500.</p><p>While the outcome of Dillon’s prenup filing remains to be determined, Joe may need to think of scaling back his wedding budget.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Shanna Moakler Fetches Nearly $100K For Travis Barker Engagement Ring</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Baller Alert</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8monGadqKTBqq%2BMnq9moKWor6K6w2aboqScpLtuvMCsqpqflWK9s7HNrqdmm5yWtq6%2FjJ%2Bpmq2UZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
