The Rocky Balboa character had plenty reason to hate Dolph after he killed his friend Apollo Creed in Rocky IV while playing Ivan Drago. But Stallone has admitted that he hated the Swede in real-life because his body was just too perfect.
Of course, the two are now great friends and have since worked together in The Expendables films, as well as Creed II, and Stallone has disclosed that there is a TV show called The International in the works."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, they did not get off to a good start because Stallone was intimidated when he first saw the muscular, chiseled wonder.</p><p>"Let me see if I can relate to you … I wanted in Rocky IV, I really wanted a big, horrible vicious guy, like a primitive, and I couldn’t find him," Stallone told host Jimmy Fallon on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>.</p><p><strong>PREVIOUSLY:&nbsp;<a title="Latest El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie Trailer Shows Jesse Pinkman On The Run" href=#>Latest El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie Trailer Shows Jesse Pinkman On The Run</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was finding giant wrestlers and football players, and then all of the sudden, the doors open, smoke comes in, there’s light, there’s the proceeding hairline and shoulders this wide. Everything is perfect. Even his calves were coming through his clothing. He was muscular.</p><p>"He was like the real Terminator, and I go, ‘I hate this friggin’ guy.' He’s just too perfect, too good looking. And if I loathe him, I’m sure the world will. He’s not really, but he looks like something that’s a thousand years in the future. This is not a guy you see waiting on your table."</p><p>Stallone would also tease a new Expendables movie after explaining his moment of jealousy, rolling his eyes while saying "And then we may do another Expendables."</p><p>So, let's all get excited about that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two action stars have some great history together and have helped each other's success but there's no telling how all of those movies would have turned out had Lundgren been rejected just because he intimidated Stallone.</p><p>Lundgren, though, isn't the first star to get on The Italian Stallion's bad side before becoming a friend. He had quite the notable feud with Arnold Schwarzenegger during the 80s and 90s that started when he threw a bowl of flowers at the Austrian during the 1977 Golden Globe Awards. As it turns out, they've blossomed into great pals too.</p><p>(Transcription from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a>)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9Kyo6%2Bdo6mys3nSrZilpJ%2Bjsm6wzqWnoWWcqruls9GepWadqKWyr7DAm6Oeq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
