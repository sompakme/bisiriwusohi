While he continues to make a ton of money from his stand-up gigs, voice-overs in movies like How To Train Your Dragon, hosting game shows (including the new ABC show The Hustler), his biggest cash cow was his late-night talk show. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Ferguson has made a $30 million net worth</a> mostly due to hosting the Late Late Show from 2005 to 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show built a massive cult following, and many still consider Craig to be the most inventive late-night host of all time. After all, he did decide to build <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Gay robot skeleton as a side-kick </a>as a way to make fun of the late-night genre as well as save money.</p><p>But Craig is also known for being one of the most authentic late-night hosts, as well. This includes the personal reason why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he defended Britney Spears much to the chagrin of the CBS network</a>, as well as his opening monologues when he lost his parents. This sense of authenticity also translated to his interviews, especially when he sat down with his sister, Lynn Ferguson Tweddle.</p><p>Craig didn't grow up an only child in Cumbernauld, Scotland. In fact, he had two older siblings (a brother and a sister) as well as a younger sister. His younger sister, Lynn, also shares a bit of the limelight. But chances are you don't know much about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, let's unveil who Craig Ferguson's younger sister really is...</p><h2 id=lynn-s-a-comedic-star-just-like-her-brother>Lynn's A Comedic Star Just Like Her Brother</h2><p>We don't know a lot about Lynn's perspective of her childhood, but we have learned a lot about Craig's. But given that Craig's early years were marked with incredibly destructive behavior, his experience kind of overshadows Lynn's. But perhaps this is what pushed Lynn to pursue a career in comedy as well.</p><p>Yes, Lynn is a full-blown comedian and is known for her stand-up shows, especially in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Craig Ferguson Really Feels About Not Getting The Letterman Gig</a></span></p><p>Just like her older sister Janice, Lynn went to Cumbernauld High School. And just like her sister, Lynn was a Prefect. Aside from that, the two have very little in common. At least according to a stand-up routine&nbsp;Lynn did for You Tell Yours. It doesn't seem as though she had much in common with her father either. But that's mostly because her father was very quiet. Even though she lived a different life than Craig, it definitely seems as though she has the most in common with him. At least when it came to the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Lynn graduated high school she worked briefly at a catering company. Soon after, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was accepted to the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama</a>.</p><p>After she graduated, Lynn Ferguson had some trouble getting work due to the lack of an Equity union card, which was only available if she got work... ironically. This inspired her to form the Alexander Sisters, a comedy act with a fellow student that parodied the comedy of the Alexander Brothers, a famous folk-music duo from Scotland.</p><p>This caused her to be side-tracked from acting and enter the stand-up world. Eventually, she earned a residence at the Red Rose Comedy Club in London, England. While she was performing comedy at night, she was also writing and presenting on a British children's show. From there, Lynn diversified as much as possible, eventually building a fanbase that allowed her to tour in Hong Kong and Melbourne, Australia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Craig Ferguson Really Left ‘The Late Late Show’</a></span></p><p>In-between touring, Lynn also wrote on a bunch of series for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio Scotland, where she wrote, as well as presented, a series about the inner-workings of the minds of comedy writers.</p><p>Over the years, she's become a mainstay in Scotland, particularly at the world-renowned Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p><h2 id=a-life-in-scotland-eventually-had-to-be-shared-with-america-thanks-to-her-brother-and-chicken-run>A Life In Scotland Eventually Had To Be Shared With America Thanks To Her Brother And Chicken Run</h2><p>For a number of years, Lynn also lived permanently in Scotland with her husband Mark Tweddle and her children. She's enjoyed motherhood and has often used her experiences in her comedy. In an interview on her brother's show, Lynn admitted to being in a "Bad Mother's Club" where she and the other moms all get a babysitter every Wednesday night and go get drunk at the bar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she built a strong career in stand-up, radio, theater, and television writing in Scotland, Lynn was feeling the call of a larger life in America.</p><p>Being cast as Mac, one of the main characters in Chicken Run, allowed Lynn to enter a larger entertainment world.</p><p>While she acted in several UK-based series, Chicken Run (as well as Chicken Run 2) remains Lynn's largest acting credits... But she did work for her brother as a writer on The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson from 2009 - 2011. On top of this, Lynn was also brought on as a writing consultant on the Disney Pixar film Brave, in which her brother was also featured. Because of all of this high-profile work,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lynn was invited to take part in the judging panel</a> for the International Emmy Awards, as well as to hos their comedy panel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after Craig's career in late-night ended, Lynn&nbsp;briefly returned to Edinburgh, Scotland. While there, she was&nbsp;involved with several high-profile and award-winning plays and the Channel 4 series No Angels.</p><p>After moving to Van Nuys, California with her business-man husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two of them started You Tell Yours</a>, a program that teaches people how better to communicate with each other through story.</p><p>In short, Lynn has been lucky enough to never stop working.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Are Craig Ferguson’s Three Wives?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBur9GaoKBllpq%2FqMHSqKWsZaOewLWx0WajsqaeYsG4scSdo55n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
