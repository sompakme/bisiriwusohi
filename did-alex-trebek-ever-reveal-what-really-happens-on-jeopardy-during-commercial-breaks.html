In this resurfaced clip from September 11, 1984, which became popular on TikTok, a remarkable and unusual scenario unfolded. None of the three contestants managed to answer the Final Jeopardy question correctly in fact, all three contestants had wagered their entire earnings on the final question, resulting in them losing everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jpg_20230823_223425_0000.jpg><p>During the Final Jeopardy round, Trebek would reveal the category for the question, and contestants were given the duration of the commercial break to place their final wagers, with partitions separating them.
