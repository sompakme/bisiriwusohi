Cody Rhodes won the Men’s 2023 Royal Rumble Match, and he is set to challenge Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 39. As a result, he has traded words with Heyman, Reigns’ special counsel, on multiple occasions. Previously, Heyman told Cody that Roman Reigns was the son his father, Dusty Rhodes, always wanted.
