Two, your size isn’t large enough relative to Earth to notice any curvature at all. It’s a fundamental fact of calculus and non-Euclidean geometry small sections of large curve surfaces will always look flat to little creatures that crawl upon it.”</p><p>Before dropping the mic (literally), Tyson also referenced a statement from world-renowned physicist, Isaac Newton: “If I have seen farther than others, it’s by standing on the shoulders of giants,” he quoted. “Can I get an amen? So that’s right B.o.B. When you stand on the shoulders of those who came before, you might just see far enough to realize the Earth isn’t fu**ing flat!”</p><p>Before Tyson made a public appearance on the occurrence, B.o.B. took his claims a step further and laid out his thought process on a reported diss track titled, “Flatline.” His tweets on the matter previously solidified his theory, writing, “A lot of people are turned off by the phrase “flat earth” … but there’s no way u can see all the evidence and not know … grow up.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A lot of people are turned off by the phrase “flat earth” … but there’s no way u can see all the evidence and not know… grow up</p><p>— B.o.B (@bobatl) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 25, 2016</a></p><p>Welp, Tyson definitely has the evidence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyqriMnZygqpGowKZ507KqqKZdl7yjecWlmK1llZa%2FtbSMrZ%2Bep6KuenV8kG5pb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
