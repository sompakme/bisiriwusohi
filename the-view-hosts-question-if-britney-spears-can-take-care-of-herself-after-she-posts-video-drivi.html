Is she still suffering? Sometimes I wonder. It seems that she is still suffering,” she said.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-happened-between-britney-spears-and-selena-gomez_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?">What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Although Gomez was a guest at Spears' wedding, many believed Spears shaded the singer on Instagram.</p><h2 id=britney-rsquo-s-behavior-has-people-questioning-if-she-rsquo-s-okay>Britney’s Behavior Has People Questioning If She’s Okay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar50084469-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hostin's co-host Sara Haines interjected, remarking, "suffering is going to be inevitable," but raised doubts about whether Spears, 42, is "capable of making decisions for her life."</p><p>In response, Hostin agreed, saying, “Is she capable? Because we’ve seen some things that have happened that’s questionable.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Britney raised concern after posting a video of herself while driving. She shared a trio of clips to Instagram of what seemed like a countryside drive, but one was clearly taken while Britney was also behind the wheel.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/two-hollywood-a-listers-might-be-to-blame-for-delayed-britney-spears-memoir.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Britney Spears' 10 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)">Britney Spears' 10 Most Popular Songs, Ranked (According To Spotify)</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Britney Spears is a worldwide superstar and one of the top 10 selling female artists ever, but how does she rank on streaming platforms?</p><p>In California, the act of using a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cellphone while driving is prohibited by law</a>, unless it is operated in a hands-free manner. This legislation strictly forbids holding a phone while driving for any purpose, including making calls, sending texts, or browsing the internet. Even if Britney had her cellphone mounted while filming and driving, the necessity to interact with the device's screen to initiate and conclude the recording constitutes a clear violation of driving regulations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Violations of this law incur fines, starting at $20 for initial offenses and escalating to $50 for subsequent violations, with additional charges included. Moreover, repeat offenders risk accumulating points on their driving records, potentially leading to higher insurance premiums and even license suspension.</p><p>Despite the apparent breach, there have been no reported consequences for Britney Spears (aside from public concern). Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether she was in California, her primary place of residence, or elsewhere while recording the clips.</p><h2 id=britney-rsquo-s-online-behavior-has-become-increasingly-disturbing>Britney’s Online Behavior Has Become Increasingly Disturbing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screen-shot-2024-02-24-at-12-01-30-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney’s potentially illegal video follows a series of incidents, including a speeding citation that she was issued in October, during which she claimed she urgently needed to return home for a restroom visit.</p><p>Prior to that, in September, the former Disney star received a citation for lacking a license or proof of insurance while driving below the speed limit.</p><p>Britney’s unconventional conduct extends to her online presence, where she has shared a range of questionable videos, and we’re not just talking about the most recent one. Last year, Britney caused great concern after sharing a video of herself dancing with knives, <a href=#>which reportedly led to a police visit</a> to her residence – and it's not an isolated incident according to reports.</p><p>Additionally, a more <a href=#>recent video surfaced showing her seemingly smoking</a> while showcasing her dance moves and engaging with fans.</p><p>For now, Britney hasn’t responded to the concerns brought up on the latest episode of The View.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dq7amw4yhpqyso2K%2BtrHSraCopl2Xv6rAzZ6wZqugmq6zv4ycmKdlpJa4pnnCmqmeZZiav7Sxy59kmp6kmr9uvM6sq6xlpp6xpruMnamirpmjtG61y6WcoJmcocZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
