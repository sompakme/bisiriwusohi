We always have a good laugh when we see each other, so I was like, ‘Ok, me and Porsha are going to kill this part.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to the 56-year-old widow, Williams never showed up to set.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1428921422.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Porsha never came,” Leakes claimed upon her arrival to LA for dress rehearsals. “We wrapped for the evening. I went back to my hotel, and when I got to my hotel, production called me and asked me if I had any issues with any&nbsp;‘Housewives’&nbsp;because they were going to be recasting the other position.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Further explaining the situation, she added, “I was later told that Porsha did not show up to work and had said that she did not want to work with me — that we had had issues from the past and she did not want to work with me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The bottom line is that Porsha did not want to share the spotlight. That’s it,” Leakes said.&nbsp;“Professionals can share the spotlight. Porsha is&nbsp;not a star, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=309105>she is a Bravolebrity</a>. Be clear.” She also expressed that she’s “more than disappointed” in Williams.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nene Leakes is reading Porsha for filth because Thotlandia didn't want to work with Nene omg</p><p>This wasn't in my bingo cards this year lol</p><p>I think it's a plot to get Nene back on <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHOA</a> lol <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/cqz9Jyx6u6</a></p>— ????? ????? ????

However, Leakes admitted that she didn’t want to invade Williams’ privacy or be “nosy.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In the midst of it all, Leakes posted an Instagram Story showing her hanging out with her man, Nyonisela Sioh, and Williams’ estranged husband Guobadia — with an unnamed woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_5060.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Williams announced last month that she would be returning&nbsp;to RHOA for Season 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Oyr7GMpZyao5WoerG70ayfmmWnnrmttcCmqmaqlZvCtLHDZq6oqptixKrAx2afnqpdZn90gJdvaHFvaWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
