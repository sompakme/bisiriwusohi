As the rest of her friends waited for her return, Nancy ended up accessing the newest villain’s memories and discovered that he was actually Henry Creel (<a href=#><strong>Jamie Campbell Bower</strong></a>) before becoming the monster.</p><p>In other parts of the season, Eleven (<a href=#><strong>Millie Bobby Brown</strong></a>) was also struggling to gain back her powers under Dr. Brenner’s (<strong>Matthew Modine</strong>) watchful eye. The first part of Season 4 ended with Eleven finding out the truth about the Hawkins Lab massacre — <a href=#>only to still have to return to Indiana to save her friends.</a></p><p>Ahead of the show’s return, several cast members admitted that they have <a href=#>considered how their onscreen stories would come to an end</a>. “I would like Murray to live. I hope he does. Of course, I am worried — it is very anxiety inducing because we are going against some very evil forces here,” <a href=#><strong>Brett Gelman</strong></a> exclusively told Us Weekly in May 2022. “So, you never know what is going to happen. He might bite the dust, or he might not.”</p><p>Although Murray is still safe (for now) in Russia, newcomer Patrick (<strong>Myles Truitt</strong>) <a href=#>faced a more terrifying end to his arc</a>. According to Truitt, he wasn’t as concerned when he <a href=#>found out that Patrick would become one of Vecna’s victims</a>.</p><p>“I wasn’t worried about anything. Once I figured that I got 6 out of 9 episodes, put me in anything. I am grateful,” he told Us at the time. “If I die, then I die. If I come back, then I come back. Regardless I am here.”</p><p>For the actor, <a href=#>the chance to work on such a memorable show</a> made the end result worth it. “I was looking forward to being observant. Taking in the different sets, how they are structured and then referencing that to what I see on camera,” he explained to Us about his first days on set. “It is a whole different experience and a whole different perspective. Then you have a different level of respect for what you do.”</p><p>Some OG cast members, however, had a different viewpoint about saying goodbye to their costars. Brown and <a href=#><strong>Noah Schnapp</strong></a> previously joked that they felt the show <a href=#>should kill some people off to make space.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re all afraid of one of us dying,” Brown told The Wrap in May 2022, before adding, “You need to start killing people off. <a href=#><strong>The Duffer Brothers</strong></a> are sensitive sallies who don’t want to kill anybody off. We need to have the mindset of Game of Thrones. Kill me off! They tried killing<a href=#><strong> David [Harbour]</strong></a> off and they brought him back!”</p><p>Scroll down to see where every Stranger Things character ended up in season 4:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowbOtzaCcq2Wknbavs9Jmqp6Zo6S7boCMsJ%2BeqpVisqKvx2aaoZmilrC1sdFmnKeco2LCsXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
