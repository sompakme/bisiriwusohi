Photos showed the duo hanging out backstage at the Dolce & Gabbana, where Khloe’s sister Kim Kardashian was debuting her new collection.</p><p>Michele went on to share a photo of himself and Khloe to his Instagram Story in a flirty pose. In the picture, the 365 Day star had his harm wrapped around Khloe, with his lips were nearly touching her ear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Immediately, social media was abuzz with rumors that Michele and Khloe were an item. Many of the reactions were positive. For instance, a <a href=#>Kardashian fan account re-tweeted the image</a>, saying they were excited to see Khloe go for someone new.</p><p>"HELPP WHAT KHLOE IS DATING MICHELE??” the account wrote. “I’m sorry but this is what Khloe needed, out with the OLD NBA Player and in with the new Italian actor! We are tired of NBA boyfriends they are walking red flags, hopefully Michele treats her right."</p><p>There appeared to be even more evidence the two were dating when a <a href=#>video surfaced showing them on a dance floor</a>. The footage shows Michele wrapping his arms around Khloe, while whispering flirtatiously into her ear.</p><p>However, it wasn’t long before Michele responded to the dating rumors. "<a href=#>There's no relationship to speak of at all</a>,” a representative for the actor said. "The two were asked to take a photo together at the D&G show. They obliged,” they continued, adding Michele thought Khloe was ”very nice.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Wildest Things Kanye West Has Done Since His Divorce From Kim K</a></span></p><h2 id=she-rsquo-s-been-dating-a-mystery-man-for-months>She’s Been Dating A Mystery Man For Months</h2><p>While Khloe may not be dating Michele Morrone, she was <a href=#>reportedly dating someone earlier in the year</a>. In June, a source told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a> that she had recently begun dating a private equity investor, who she was introduced to through her sister Kim.</p><p>“The insider says the relationship is still in its early stages, but Kardashian is feeling really good with her new mystery man — a private equity investor she met when sister Kim Kardashian introduced them at a dinner party a few weeks ago,” the publication explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Days earlier, Khloe responded to an online rumor that she was dating another NBA player. To this, Khloe appeared to imply she was single. "<a href=#>Definitely NOT True</a>!!!" she wrote. "I am not seeing a soul. I am happy focusing on my daughter and myself for a while."</p><p>Also in July, a source spoke to <a href=#>E! News</a> to emphasize Khloe was taking things slow with her mystery man. "It's not serious,” they explained. "She's been low-key and hasn't dated much lately,” the insider continued. "Khloe is definitely very open to dating but isn't forcing anything."</p><p>However, two months later in August, it was reportedly over between Khloe and the mysterious private equity investor. An insider told <a href=#>E! News</a> that their romance "slowly fizzled out over the last few weeks.” The news came days after Khloe welcomed a second child via surrogate with her ex Tristan Thompson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Khloe is enjoying being single with her sole focus on being a mom and her work," the source continued. "Khloe is open to finding love again if the right person comes into her life but is really happy right now. She is not looking and in no rush."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Is Behati Prinsloo Sticking With Adam Levine After His Scandal?</a></span></p><h2 id=things-seem-to-be-over-for-good-with-tristan-thompson>Things Seem To Be Over For Good With Tristan Thompson</h2><p>It’s unknown if Khloe is dating someone new right now, but what does seem to be confirmed is that things are over between her and Tristan. The NBA player has a long history of cheating on Khloe during their times together. He was first exposed for infidelity days ahead of their daughter True’s birth in 2018. Though Khloe and Tristan later got back together, they broke up after he allegedly kissed Jordyn Woods, Kylie Jenner’s then-best friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last year, Tristan and Khloe were back together again and even discussing using a surrogate to have another child. But by December, they broke up amid news that Tristan had fathered a child with another woman while with Khloe (a baby he's allegedly never met to this day).</p><p>However, fans were shocked when a representative for Khloe confirmed in July they were having baby no. 2 via surrogate. The rep said the surrogate became pregnant before Khloe knew of his latest infidelities.</p><p>"<a href=#>We can confirm True will have</a> a sibling who was conceived in November,” they said. “Khloé is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing. We'd like to ask for kindness and privacy so that Khloé can focus on her family.”</p><p>Reports said the <a href=#>former couple weren’t speaking</a> outside of co-parenting topics up until the birth of their son. Khloe remains relatively tight lipped on the whole situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMpJ%2Blp5Woeq%2Bx1maZqLGWp7amusNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
