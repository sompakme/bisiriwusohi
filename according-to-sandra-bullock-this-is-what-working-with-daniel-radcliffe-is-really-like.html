While on a book tour, she is kidnapped by Radcliffe’s Abigail Fairfax, who believes she can help him find lost treasure in an ancient city.

But it was my sister’s birthday and she is a huge Harry Potter fan, so I got her an autograph.”</p><p>Interestingly, the publication reports that Radcliffe has previously been banned from signing Harry Potter memorabilia when working on other projects. When he starred in the play Equus, he was asked to sign his name on programs for the play only, rather than Harry Potter posters and other material.</p><p>So fans are left to wonder whether Radcliffe signed Harry Potter merchandise for Bullock, or The Lost City paraphernalia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-daniel-radcliffe-find-working-with-sandra-bullock>How Did Daniel Radcliffe Find Working With Sandra Bullock?</h2><p>As it turns out, Sandra Bullock wasn’t the only one who enjoyed her time on The Lost City set. Daniel Radcliffe also opened up about his experience on the film, confirming that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he loved working with Bullock</a> after admiring her as an actress when he was younger.</p><p>“Working with Sandy was a real 'pinch yourself' moment, because I did grow up watching her, and have been a fan of hers for so long,” Radcliffe explained in an interview with Empire. “So to actually get to be in a movie with her is still mind-blowing to me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Harry Potter Star Never Wanted To Be Part Of The Franchise, And Here's Why</a></span></p><p>He had grown up watching several iconic Sandra Bullock movies, including Miss Congeniality, While You Were Sleeping, Infamous, and later in life, Speed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Radcliffe also revealed that she was approachable and friendly on set, even encouraging him to call her Sandy: “She encourages you to call her Sandy, and I would do that, and then if I was talking to any of my friends at home and said ‘Sandy’, they were like, "Oh! Sandy, is it?!" And I'm like, "Yes, I know, it sounds weird, but she's asked me to."</p><p>It looks like the love is mutual.
