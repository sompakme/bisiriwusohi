Check out the unique ways the humble, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">New Jersey</a> man chooses to spend his fortune.</p><h2 id=close-to-home>Close to Home</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Springsteen owns property in Los Angeles and Wellington, FL, alongside the likes of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Bill Gates</a>, he’s primarily bought property near his hometown of Freehold, N.J. Most notably, the 400-acre <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">horse farm</a> in Colts Neck. A dream of Springsteen’s for decades, just 10 minutes from his childhood home, the massive property serves as a get-away from nights on the road and includes his favorite spaces to record music.</p><h2 id=a-favorite-among-many>A Favorite Among Many</h2><p>Though Springsteen has an impressive collection of guitars, there’s one that stands out to him and fans alike. The Fender electric guitar the E Street Band front man purchased at Phil Petillo’s guitar shop in 1973 for $185 has been the one piece of equipment Springsteen has played for more than 40 years. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, when it was obvious his favorite guitar was deteriorating and could no longer withstand the touring schedule, it was retired with an <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">estimated worth between $1 million and $5 million</a>. What did Springsteen do? He still records with the original, but fans are looking at a clone of his prized possession on stage today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Bruce Springsteen Sells His Entire Catalog To Sony For $500 Million</a></span></p><h2 id=car-collection>Car Collection</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>, the famous singer owns several classic Chevy and Ford models but isn’t against modern vehicles like the Range Rover and Jeep. From a Chevy Impala Convertible, gifted to him by singer Gary Bonds and a 1960 Chevrolet Corvette C1 Convertible, Springsteen can boast an <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">impressive collection </a>but claims the Chevy Bel Air Convertible was by far his favorite purchase. In his memoir, Born to Run, Springsteen talks about the $2,000 he shelled out for the baby-blue car with custom orange flames spread across the hood and a zero to 60 acceleration in seconds.</p><h2 id=animals-galore>Animals Galore</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Growing up in “horse heaven” Springsteen’s daughter, Jessica, recently shared her <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">experience on the farm </a>her father always dreamed of having. Years on Stone Hill Farm brought numerous horses to the property but goats, chicken and pigs as well. The famed equestrian recalls two ostriches but they didn’t last long with their less than desirable demeanor.</p><h2 id=staying-healthy>Staying Healthy</h2><p>The 72-year-old rockstar has to stay fit and healthy in order to continue those three-hour concerts he regularly puts on. Springsteen has said he <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">has a personal trainer </a>and though he’s starting to slow down (walking versus running), he still lifts weights several days per week. Ultimately, however, The Boss is all about diet. He doesn’t eat too much or foods not good for you and that’s 90 percent of the game, according to Springsteen.</p><h2 id=making-those-healthy-meals>Making Those Healthy Meals</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It does however, become a little easier with a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">personal chef </a>by your side. The superstar doesn’t have to cook because he pays for an expert to come in and create those healthy meals for he and his family. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.</a>, Springsteen’s personal chef was once employed by the king of Saudi Arabia.</p><h2 id=supporting-family>Supporting Family</h2><p>Springsteen married Julianne Phillips in 1985 but divorced in 1988 after his touring took a toll on their relationship. He found Patti Scialfa, another New Jersey native who joined the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">E Street Band</a>, who became the love of his life. Springsteen and Scialfa married in 1991 and have three children: Evan James, Jessica Rae and Samuel Ryan. Jessica is a champion rider, who represented the United States Equestrian Team in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">2020 Tokyo Olympics</a>.</p><h2 id=love-for-the-troops>Love For The Troops</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Springsteen failed tests to join the Army during the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Vietnam War</a>, he’s made it clear he <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">supports and honors those who have fought for our freedom</a>. In fact, many of Springsteen’s songs reflect his feelings, including Born in the U.S.A. and 1999’s American Skin.</p><p>With <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">two private foundations</a>, the giving singer has granted more than $3 million through The Thrill Hill Foundation and The Foundation Inc. has funded $1.5 million toward housing repairs for low-income families in New Jersey. In addition, it’s not uncommon to find Springsteen headlining a charity concert alongside his friends.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Inside The Fancy Homes Of The Greatest Rockstars Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Hot Cars</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnBq6ycnV2ovbO1zaCqrZ2Vo3q0vMSnm6xlmJ7AbrnArKqirpVis7C%2B066lnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
