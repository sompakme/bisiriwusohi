Since Travis started dating Swift, the “New Heights” podcast episodes have become a place <a href=#>to recap their public date nights</a> and her attendance at his <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> games.</p><p class=p3>Travis <a href=#>first expressed interest in the Grammy winner</a> during a July episode of his podcast, revealing<a href=#> he failed to gift her a DIY friendship bracelet</a> after he went to her <a href=#><i>Eras Tour </i>concert</a> at the Chiefs’ Arrowhead Stadium. The pair eventually connected and <a href=#>went on a couple of private dates</a> before Travis <a href=#>invited her to watch him “rock the stage”</a> at Arrowhead Stadium. Swift<a href=#> attended her first Chiefs game</a> last month, <a href=#>sitting in his private box</a> next to his mother, <a href=#><strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jason-kelce-jokes-travis-will-kill-me-for-taylor-swift-name-drop-inline.jpg><p class=p3>“Shout-out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy,” Travis <a href=#>gushed on the podcast days later</a>. “I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite <a href=#>had nothing but great things to say</a> about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing … and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans. We script it all, ladies and gentlemen. It was absolutely electric.”</p><p class=p3>He continued: “To see the slow motion chest bumps, to see the high fives with mom, to see how Chiefs kingdom was all excited that she was there … it was definitely a game I’ll remember, that’s for damn sure.”</p><p class=p3>Swift has since <a href=#>stepped out at two more Chiefs games</a> earlier this month, <a href=#>all decked out in Chiefs merch</a>. She and Travis then went on <a href=#>a series of public dinner dates in New York City</a> last weekend after <a href=#>surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere</a> of <a href=#><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a>.</p><p class=p3>Jason, who is <a href=#>married to <strong>Kylie Kelce</strong></a>, gushed on the Wednesday, October 18, episode of “New Heights” that his brother is definitely displaying <a href=#>prime “boyfriend material”</a> during the date nights.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>While Swift has not publicly addressed <a href=#>the new romance</a>, a source told <i>Us Weekly </i>earlier this month that “she is falling for him more and more” as they continue getting to know each other.</p><p class=p3>“[Travis] goes out of his way to&nbsp;make Taylor feel special&nbsp;in any way he can,”<a href=#> the insider exclusively told <i>Us </i></a>at the time. “Taylor couldn’t believe the massive bouquet of flowers Travis sent to her just because. He makes her feel safe and protected, and at the same time, he supports her independence and success.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaOku263xKWanmWapLimv4ytqZqumah6uLXLpWSkoZyheq6xjJ%2Bmq2Wklsatu9FmqrChlql6r63MnmSdqp%2BlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
