The series, which takes place years before the events in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, examines Ratched’s progression from nurse to monster as she works her way through the mental health care system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As an origin story, Ratched delves into the nurse’s childhood, relationships and sexuality. Murphy’s premise was that abusers are often people who have endured abuse. Joining the title character are Dr. Hanover, a pioneering doctor who subjects his patients to controversial treatments; mass murderer Edmund Tolleson; hospital staff members Dolly and Huck; eccentric heiress Lenore Osgood; private investigator Charles Wainwright; motel manager Louise; and politician Governor George Wilburn and his campaign manager Gwendolyn Briggs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series seems to share many elements with <a href=#>American Horror Story</a>, which explored Briarcliff Manor, a hospital the criminally insane, in American Horror Story: Asylum.&nbsp;The second entry in the anthology series, which debuted in 2012, also starred&nbsp;Paulson as&nbsp;Lana Winters, an ambitious journalist who works her way into the hospital to interview a killer. Winters is eventually committed to the asylum herself for her homosexuality.</p><p>The cast of Ratched also includes Jon Jon Briones, Finn Wittrock, Charlie Carver, Alice Englert, Amanda Plummer, Corey Stoll, Sophie Okenedo, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The series, based on a spec script by Evan Romansky, includes among its executive producers Michael Douglas, who produced the 1975 film.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Witcher Is Getting A Prequel Series Set 1200 Years Before Season One</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiqkamwqbHDZpirqpmrsrR5yKdkrJ2gqbKursSrZKimXaOytbLLoq9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
