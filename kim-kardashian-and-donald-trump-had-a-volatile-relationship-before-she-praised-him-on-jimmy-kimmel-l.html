Other possible topics might have been the awe-inspiring lifestyle Kim leads thanks to being a member of the <a href=#>rich Kardashian-Jenner family</a>, her family life, or her <a href=#>clothing business Skims</a>.</p><p>However, huge Kim Kardashian fans know that she once spent quite a bit of time meeting with Donald Trump when he was in the White House. Since several years have passed since that initial meeting and Trump was in court for his hush money trial in April 2024, it's hard not to be curious about what Kim thinks about him now.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>how Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump got along before her Jimmy Kimmel interview</strong>, along with what she said about the former President during this episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-kim-kardashian-and-donald-trump-39-s-relationship-before-her-jimmy-kimmel-live-comments>Inside Kim Kardashian And Donald Trump's Relationship Before Her Jimmy Kimmel Live! Comments</h2><p>While Kim Kardashian talked about Donald Trump on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, there is a lot more to the story of their relationship. It's important to note that things started out well between the two... but their relationship was a negative one before her comments on Kimmel. According to Business Insider, <strong>Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump talked about criminal justice reform </strong>at the White House in 2018 and 2020. In 2018, Trump tweeted, "Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_kim-kardashian-s-jimmy-kimmel-interview-reminded-fans-of-these-wild-and-perplexing-rumors_bk_a1.jpg><p>Business Insider reported that Donald Trump was then angry when Kim Kardashian asked him to release someone from prison, he said, according to the book "Tired Of Winning" by Jonathan Karl:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Hell no.

This was several years before her April 2024 Jimmy Kimmel live! interview and proof that their relationship soured after they initially seemed to get along. While Trump was once open to hearing what Kim had to say, it sounds like he didn't want to talk to her anymore and wasn't going to consider helping her prison reform cause.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/donald-trump-was-the-victim-of-fake-news-about-a-remarkable-tip-he-supposedly-left-a-waiter-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which Stars Did Trump Fight With In 2017?</p><ul><li>Rosie O'Donnell</li><li>Meryl Streep</li><li>Madonna</li><li>Mark Cuban</li><li>Chrissy Teigen</li><li>Steph Curry</li><li>Michael Moore</li><li>Anna Wintour</li></ul><p>While the two figures seemed to be able to have a polite conversation about prison sentences and justice back in 2018, things changed just a few years later. <strong>Donald Trump also called Kim Kardashian "overrated," </strong>which is definitely insulting. This proves that even though they once got along, their relationship changed and he didn't seem willing to say anything nice or positive about her.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:03</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/donald-trump-s-relationship-with-hugh-hefner-took-a-turn-nobody-was-expecting-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Donald Trump's Relationship With Hugh Hefner Took A Turn Nobody Was Expecting</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>It appeared as though Donald Trump and Hugh Hefner were close, but things took a turn before the death of the Playboy founder.</span><p>According to The Hill, Trump tweeted about Karl's claim in his book "Tired Of Winning" that Trump wanted Kim to ask football players to make a White House visit. Trump tweeted:</p><p>“In the ‘book’ he has the World’s most overrated celebrity, Kim Kardashian, supposedly telling me that she ‘would leverage her celebrity to get football stars to come to the White House,’ if I would commute the sentences of various prisoners.

Magazine, Trump answered questions about various celebrities in 2023 on the podcast Full Send. <strong>Trump called Kim "disingenuous," </strong>which might not be surprising, given the other things that he said about her in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As she shared in a 2023 interview with Time Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim has cared about criminal justice</a> for a long time and has tried to help get people released from prison. Since this was a cause close to her heart, Kim must have been happy to talk to the then President about it. Since Donald Trump began insulting Kim Kardashian<strong> </strong>a few years after they discussed criminal justice in 2018, that must have been upsetting for her. She was particularly passionate about helping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alice Marie Johnson who was given a life sentence</a> for a conspiracy related to substances.</p><p>Donald Trump insulted Kim Kardashian's pregnant body in 2013. According to Us Weekly, he appeared on HLN's Showbiz Tonight and said, “She’s gotten a little bit large."
