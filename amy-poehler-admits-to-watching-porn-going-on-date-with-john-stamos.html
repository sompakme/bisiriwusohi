I got married in 2003 and all of a sudden I’m like, ‘Oh, right. Now you text somebody.’ That was new. There were times when I was out with guys and I was like, ‘Oh, I think I might be on a date, but I don’t know,'” she added, before revealing she dined with one of Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I remember I was at dinner with John Stamos…handsome men are really something else…We were having dinner and I was like, ‘Oh, maybe this is a date!’ But I didn’t know,” Poehler said. “But I kind of blew it…I remember thinking like, ‘Oh, s–t. Like, if this is really a date…’ I think I was wearing a Leslie Knope top. I think I was wearing a shirt from work,” she laughed.</p><p>Poehler said she “didn’t f–k” Stamos and that she really only dates people she knows. “I’ve usually dated people that I have been friends with, and I’m dating someone now. I have a boyfriend whom I’ve known for a very long time before we started dating,” she added of beau and fellow comedy star <strong>Nick Kroll</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Poehler said Arnett and Kroll “know each other [and] it’s all fine,” but don’t expect Kroll and Poehler to rush into things. “It’s great to not live with somebody,” said the Parks and Recreation star, who shares sons<strong> Archie</strong>, 6, and <strong>Abel</strong>, 4, with Arnett. “I don’t know if I ever want to live with somebody else again.”</p><p>The Baby Mama actress went on to talk about sex, saying that she knows she’s good in bed and yes, she watches porn — regularly.</p><p>“I like my porn like my comedy: Done by professionals, women who are at the top of their game. So, I like professional ladies who are enjoying themselves. I’m not an amateur person. I want everybody to look good and be good at their jobs,” she said, before realizing: “Oh my god! I just remembered my dad’s listening to this! Sorry, dad! I just called him this morning and was like, ‘I’m gonna be on Stern this morning!’ S–t! Sorry, dad! Love you, pop!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapalivbCxx6Wcq2WRmbqqwNJmq6hlp5bBpLTIp55mqJ%2Bnu26zzqKloGWfo3qlrdOeZLChpJ16q7vHp2SsrJGivLR5kWlobWpnZn1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
