We went from only wearing it at home to wanting to show off our new pieces and sets to everyone. So comfy, so cute. The trend hasn’t quite made its way everywhere yet though. In most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">offices</a>, for example, it doesn’t really fit into the dress code — even when that dress code is leaning toward casual.</p><p>But what if we spend 40+ hours a week in the office — plus the time it takes the commute there and back? That’s a long time to not be feeling any type of comfy. Yes, we want to look professional when giving presentations, meeting with clients or gathering for a meeting — but we don’t want to be distracted the whole time with our stiff pants digging into our skin. That’s why we were so excited to find <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these neezeelee pants</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">neezeelee Dress Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35</a> at Amazon!

They have a skinny fit, but they aren’t clingy or compressive like a pair of leggings. The fabric has a four-way stretch, and the wide, high-rise waistband is super figure-flattering. Notice how there’s no zipper or button there. These are pull-on style!</p><p>What dresses <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these pants</a> up are the spacious front pockets and the back welt pockets, plus the specially designed contour seams included to subtly hug and lift. The thick fabric is also designed to stay wrinkle-free. These details make these pants look like a pair of well-tailored dress trousers. Meanwhile, they’re ready for naps and Netflix binges. You could even work out in them; they’re moisture-wicking! You might just confuse some people at the gym.</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">neezeelee Dress Pants</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$35</a> at Amazon!
