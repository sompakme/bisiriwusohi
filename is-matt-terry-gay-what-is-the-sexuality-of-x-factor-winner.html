In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OK! magazine</a>, he even chuckled at the persistent gay rumors.</p><p>His track record of dating women in the past stands as a testament to his straight sexual orientation, putting the speculation to rest.</p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Pedro Pascal Gay?
