She explained on Selling Sunset’s reunion episode how there are other ways to have children and love can come from anywhere, any time. Stause and G Flip are defying age gaps and gender norms, so let’s get into exactly what makes them so special.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Why Chrishell Stause And Jason Oppenheim Didn't Film Their Breakup</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-g-flip><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is G Flip?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have a lot of questions about Chrishell Stause’s new partner. G Flip, whose full name is Georgia Flipo. They are an extremely talented musician from Australia and play many instruments as well as sing. They are most known for their songs “About You,” “Drink Too Much,” and “GET ME OUTTA HERE.”</p><p>G Flip is non-binary and goes by they/them pronouns. Stause stated on Selling Sunset that she is attracted to masculine energy and that she is drawn to the personality of someone rather than their physical appearance. G Flip's energy clearly fit the bill for Stause as they are now happily in a relationship.</p><h2 id=how-did-g-flip-and-chrishell-meet><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Did G Flip And Chrishell Meet?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>G Flip and Stause met on set. Flipo cast Chrishell in their most recent music video for “GET ME OUTTA HERE.” Stause spoke on Selling Sunset about how excited she was to act again after taking such a long break from soap operas. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The two got hot and heavy while filming</a>, so it is no surprise their chemistry grew into something more.</p><p>The video and song are now streaming on all platforms, giving viewers an inside peak into their beginning. Their public displays of affection continue on their Instagram pages and in adorable paparazzi photos. These two can't seem to get enough of each other!</p><h2 id=how-old-is-georgia-flipo-and-how-old-is-chrishell><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Old Is Georgia Flipo (And How Old Is Chrishell)?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>G Flip is only 27! This is a big change for Chrishell Stause. Previously, Stause had only dated people closer to her age, such as Justin Hartley and Jason Oppenheim. As a 40-year-old woman, Stause is at a very different stage in her life than G Flip. Stause is looking to settle down and have a family, and fans worry G Flip is still enjoying their roaring twenties. However, this large age gap does not seem to affect the happy couple. After all, age is just a number. The two appear hopelessly in love and on the same page with what they want.</p><h2 id=chrishell-and-justin-hartley-split-in-2021><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chrishell And Justin Hartley Split In 2021</span></h2><p>Chrishell Stause’s famous break-up was in the public eye when Justin Hartley filed for divorce back in November 2019.

Hartley seems to have completely moved on from the split and <a href=#>does not have anything to say about Stause or her new relationship</a>.
