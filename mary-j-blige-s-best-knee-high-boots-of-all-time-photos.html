She’s teamed up with designers to create custom looks and rocked shoes straight off the runway.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her decision to opt for boots over heels started at the onset of her career. In a 2018 interview with The Cut, Blige explained that her fashion choices weren’t just a reflection of her “tomboy” demeanor (she “hated” dresses and skirts), but also served as a tool for “survival” in the industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I worked with a lot of men and grew up around a lot of men,” she said at the time. “I didn’t want them to look at me like that. I kind of sat like them, talked like them, even subconsciously, so they wouldn’t look at me like I’m a girl.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><span class=s1>While her original shoe style focused on shorter, flatter boots that hit just below the knee, she eventually evolved into wearing thigh-high boots with skinny heels. </span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Blige’s stylist, <strong>Misa Hylton</strong> touched on the singer’s evolution in a 2021 interview with NYLON. “Our creative process has always been very organic and authentic to whatever stage we were at in our lives,” she said. “In the beginning, there was a lot of focus on street style and hip hop wear: combat boots, baseball caps and jerseys.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>She continued: “Then as we both grew as young women, the styles continued to transform, but always keeping those hip hop elements like the hoop earrings and the combat boot turned into a thigh-high boot and so on.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Most recently, the Queen of Hip Hop debuted a custom pair of Peter Dundas leather boots during her halftime performance at the 2022 Super Bowl. The shoes featured stunning floral silver appliques — and naturally came along with a matching hat and outfit. The whole look sent fans into a tizzy, with many taking to social media to share their obsession.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>To see Blige’s fabulous footwear from the Super Bowl — and all of her other amazing fashion moments — keep scrolling.
