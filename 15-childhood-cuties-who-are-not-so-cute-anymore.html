Well, some of them grew up to be truly beautiful adults. Unfortunately, some have not.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People often change so much over the years, it becomes almost impossible to even recognize them after all that time and Hollywood stars are no different. There is always a lot of pressure on you when you are a celebrity, and some of them don’t really handle all that too well so they succumb to drugs or other addictions that have a really bad impact on their looks. For others, it is all about the genetics and there is very little you can do about that, you are who you are. That being said, you will be really surprised when you see how much have some of the cutest on-screen munchkins changed over the past decades. Even the most adorable ones don’t look all that adorable anymore, not to mention some of their not so adorable adult behavior.</p><p>So with all that in mind, let’s take a look at 15 cute childhood munchkins then and now and let’s see which ones of them are not so cute anymore!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=frankie-muniz>Frankie Muniz</h2><p>Malcolm in the Middle was one of those sitcoms that everybody watched at one point. It was a show about a pretty dysfunctional family with two weird parents and their 4 sons. The show focuses on the struggle of the middle child, Malcolm, portrayed by Frankie Muniz. Frankie was so adorable playing that geeky kid who was so very different than the rest of his family. He was both cute and funny and it was easy to feel for him with all the troubles his family put him through. However, when you look at Frankie today, there is very little of that cuteness left there. While many other child stars have grown up to be real babes, Frankie just isn’t one of them. On the contrary, there is almost nothing attractive about him today, except maybe for his kind of cute smile, but even that is up&nbsp;for debate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-macnaughton>Robert MacNaughton</h2><p>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&nbsp;was such a big deal back in the ‘80s when it was released and it is still kind of a big deal today. You don’t have to like it, but you have definitely seen that movie, probably more than once. So do you remember that cute little kid, Michael? Well, that’s what Robert MacNaughton looked like back in the days. For the record, he looks nothing like that today. It’s kind of a bummer when you think about that because the other kids from that movie have grown up to be pretty good looking adults. Both Drew Barrymore and Henry Thomas still look pretty awesome, but Robert really didn’t manage to keep any part of his childhood cuteness. Maybe it’s the awkward bleached dreads he usually wears, or maybe it is just the overall look, but it definitely doesn’t work for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mayim-bialik>Mayim Bialik</h2><p>Mayim Bialik has never been a true beauty, but she was a pretty cute kid back in the days when she portrayed Blossom in a sitcom named after her character. Blossom was a teenager who lived in a house run by men and Bialik did a pretty good job there. However, since then, she grew up and, today, we are used to seeing her playing Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler in The Big Bang Theory. Sure, she has to seem super geeky and awkward as a part of her role, but even when you try to look beyond that, there is nothing really attractive or adorable about her. She is really smart and she seems to have grown up into a nice person, but her looks are a whole other story.</p><h2 id=taran-noah-smith>Taran Noah Smith</h2><p>In Taran Noah Smith’s case, both his career and his cuteness ended once he grew up. His mother signed a 7-year contract with the creators of the Home Improvement series and Taran spent a big part of his childhood on the set. He was a really adorable child, but once the series was over, he found himself kind of lost. When the final season was wrapped up, he didn’t know what to do next but, instead of looking for the new projects, he stopped acting completely. He got involved with a woman that was twice his age, he wasted most of his earnings, and he even lost contact with his family for a while. Luckily, he is getting his life back on track now, but his acting career and his cuteness seem to be permanently lost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steven-anthony-lawrence>Steven Anthony Lawrence</h2><p>Steven Anthony Lawrence is one of those people that have changed so much over the years that no one even recognizes him when he walks down the street. Even he thinks so and he confirmed that people often have no idea that this bald dude he sees when he looks in the mirror is actually cute little Beans from Even Stevens. Even Stevens is a family sitcom from the early 2000s about the adventures of the Stevens family. Lawrence was one cute and really funny looking kid and the role of Beans suited him perfectly and he will probably always be remembered for it. However, as the years went by, he changed into an even funnier looking guy – but not in a good way. There is definitely nothing cute about him today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dustin-diamond>Dustin Diamond</h2><p>Dustin Diamond maybe wasn’t a cute kid per se, but he was a super cute Screech in the Saved by the Bell. However, once his work there was done, everything about his life went downhill. He filmed, directed, and released his own racy film; he was arrested after a man in a bar was stabbed and Diamond allegedly pulled out his switchblade knife during the altercation; he was sentenced to four months in prison, released on probation after three, and then arrested again for violating the terms of his probation etc. All in all, nothing really cute about his adult behavior at all. He might have been a truly adorable kid, but he turned out to be one of those people you simply just want to avoid on the streets if possible.</p><h2 id=michael-fishman>Michael Fishman</h2><p>No matter what other acting work Michael Fishman ever does, he will always be remembered for portraying D.J. Conner in the sitcom Roseanne that ran for 9 long seasons. It was one of those series everybody loved back in the days and everybody thought little Fishman was beyond adorable playing his role. He spent most of the time between the age of 6 and 15 on the set, and he was devastated when his job there was done. However, he didn’t go down the wrong path at that point; instead, he focused on his studies, he got married, and he has been living a pretty peaceful life ever since. Basically, there is nothing wrong with him, but people are still pretty disappointed simply because they were used to see him all young and as cute as a button.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-lipnicki>Jonathan Lipnicki</h2><p>Jonathan Lipnicki was just the cutest little kid. He made his film debut in Jerry Maguire, and then he was all adorable and cute in Stuart Little again. Who could resist those big blue eyes, cute glasses, and a lovely smile? Well, unfortunately, all that that was so adorable about him when he was a kid changed into not so adorable once he grew up. Basically, he turned into one weird looking dude. However, even though he isn’t that cute little kid we got used to seeing on the screen anymore, his acting career is still going pretty well and he has been working on a variety of different projects over the last couple of years. Maybe we’ll even get used to seeing him looking like he does today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fred-savage>Fred Savage</h2><p>So how awesome was The Princess Bride, people? Is there anybody who doesn’t love that movie? So do you remember that little kid that was laying sick in bed and listening to the story his grandfather read to him? That cute little kid with the most adorable smile ever was Fred Savage. If you, by any chance haven’t seen this movie, then you probably remember Fred from The Wonder Years, a TV series where he portrayed Kevin Arnold between the years 1988 and 1993.</p><p>When you look at Fred today, he is far from being bad-looking, but is he still really cute? No, he is not. Sure, there is still a certain charm to that great smile of his, but that is basically where the cuteness ends for him.</p><h2 id=brandon-call>Brandon Call</h2><p>Brandon Call was a super cute kid that later turned into a real teen heartthrob, but it all went downhill with him from there. He is best known for playing J.T. Lambert in the family sitcom Step by Step between the years 1991 and 1998. In 1996, just after finishing tapping one of the episodes, he got into a traffic dispute and got shot into both arms. However, he made a full recovery and continued his work on the series until the very end of the show. Once the last season was wrapped up, it seemed like Brandon decided to end his acting career, and his good looks basically ended right then and there as well. Nothing of that initial cuteness was left there once he grew up and he turned into a pretty unattractive adult.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sean-astin>Sean Astin</h2><p>Sean Astin is hardly as cute as an adult as he was when he was a kid, but that doesn’t change the fact that he is still a pretty talented and successful actor. He made his acting debut back in 1985 in Spielberg’s Goonies and he has had a number of great roles ever since. He is probably best known for portraying a hobbit Samwise Gamgee in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. So there is no denying he has done some pretty great job so far, but it is also pretty obvious that he really isn’t one of the most attractive actors out there. All those things that were so adorable about him when he was a little kid turned into not so&nbsp;attractive adult qualities when it comes to his appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeremy-james-miller>Jeremy James Miller</h2><p>Jeremy James Miller has had a number of good acting gigs, but most people remember him as little Ben Seaver in the popular TV series Growing Pains. And here we have a great example of two cute childhood actors who grew up very differently. As the matter of the fact, Leonardo DiCaprio also played a role in this series, but while he grew up and his childhood cuteness was replaced by a certain adult charm, charisma, and pretty good looks, Jeremy James Miller’s cuteness just vanished and wasn’t really replaced by anything too attractive. However, he seems like a pretty cool dude with a good sense of humor, so there is at least that. His childhood cuteness also caused him some troubles back in the days. Apparently, he had an older male stalker during the years of his work in Growing Pains.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiffany-michelle-brissette>Tiffany Michelle Brissette</h2><p>Tiffany Michelle Brissette was a star of the show Small Wonder where she portrayed Vicky Lawson, a robot in the form of a 10-year-old girl created by a robotic engineer who pretended it was his adopted daughter. She did a great job in pretending to be an unemotional robot trying to integrate into the family, and people really expected to see great things from her in her future jobs. However, that didn’t happen. Tiffany went from being a small wonder to being no wonder at all. She had a couple of small gigs after the series, but nothing too significant. Eventually, she left her acting career completely and started working as a nurse in Colorado. As far as her looks go, she isn’t bad-looking per se, but she is far from that cute little girl we used to see on the screen.</p><h2 id=michael-oliver-actor>Michael Oliver (Actor)</h2><p>Michael Oliver was born in Los Angeles in 1981, and he started his acting career at only 2 years old. He appeared in a number of commercials, but he is best known for portraying Junior in Problem Child and Problem Child 2. He used to be just the cutest little redhead boy you have ever seen, especially since he played a little mischievous boy who used to drive his adoptive parents crazy. However, once he grew up, nobody has really heard anything about him anymore. There have been some issues during the filming of the Problem Child 2 when Universal Pictures sued Oliver’s mom (who was also his manager) for extorting his contract. Apparently, she threatened to remove him from production if they didn’t raise his pay almost 6 times over the agreed sum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlie-korsmo>Charlie Korsmo</h2><p>Charlie Korsmo is a former child actor who changed his career path completely and became a lawyer once he grew up. However, his career wasn’t the only thing that has changed. His looks also changed completely and he went from being a cute little munchkin to being a pretty weird-looking dude. None of that changes the fact that he was a pretty successful child actor back then and he is a pretty successful lawyer today as well, so good for him! You might remember him portraying Jack Banning in the movie Hook; Nicky MacKee in The Doctor, Kid in Dick Tracey, and so on. His active career lasted only around 2 years + one appearance 7 years later, but he still got a couple of nominations for the most promising actor and similar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5lk522rbDHqKadZZOqwaqx0mauoaddlr%2Bmec2oq2arn2KwtsDEZpinsZ2kv6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
