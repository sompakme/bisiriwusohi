Obviously best known as the star of the beloved sitcom Seinfeld, Jerry co-created the show, served as its showrunner, and played the series lead character. Considering that <a href=#>Seinfeld remains popular enough that millions of fans still want to know everything they can about the show</a>, Jerry clearly could have rested on his laurels there. Instead, Jerry went on to create and host Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee and he continues to perform standup comedy all over the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though he is best known as someone who has made the masses laugh for years, <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld has done some very controversial things</a> over the years. On top of that, Jerry has been steadily building a reputation as a grumpy guy in recent years. After all, when Jerry goes on talk shows, he seems to take great delight in calling interviewers out. On top of that, Jerry once infamously felt the need to call <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a> out very publically. With that in mind, it probably shouldn’t surprise anyone that Jerry clearly can’t stand a comedy legend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Episode Of 'Seinfeld' Was So Controversial That NBC Forced Jerry To Throw Out The Script</a></span></p><h2 id=bobcat-goldthwait-rsquo-s-legendary-career>Bobcat Goldthwait’s Legendary Career</h2><p>These days, a lot of young comedy fans may not have any idea who Bobcat Goldthwait is. However, at the height of Goldthwait’s career, Bobcat easily was one of the most talked-about comedians and performers in the world. Known for performing on stage with great energy while speaking in a raspy and high-pitched voice, Goldthwait quickly took the comedy world by storm.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the release of the comedy specials An Evening with Bobcat Goldthwait —Share the Warmth and Bob <a href=#>Goldthwait</a> —Is He Like That All the Time?, the titular comedian became a major star. At the same time, Goldthwait was being paid a fortune to continue performing on stage, he began to simultaneously find success in his acting career. After all, Goldthwait starred in successful films like Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment and Scrooged, on top of voicing Mr. Floppy in the live-action sitcom Unhappily Ever After. Ever since the mid-200s, Goldthwait has stepped away from acting to mostly concentrate on directing several acclaimed independent films.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Mourn Police Academy Star Marion Ramsey As She Dies Age 73</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jerry-clearly-can-rsquo-t-stand-bobcat>Jerry Clearly Can’t Stand Bobcat</h2><p>After Bobcat Goldthwait rose to fame in large part due to the distinct way he delivered his comedy onstage, he decided to leave behind the voice that made him famous. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Goldthwait told the AV Club in 2021, it had been “at least 15 years” since he completely dropped the voice</a> at that time. Despite abandoning the calling card that brought him to the world’s attention, Goldthwait has continued to enjoy success as a director and comedian. Still, Jerry Seinfeld continues to look down on Goldthwait due to the voice he used during the first phase of his career.</p><p>In 2019, an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee featuring Bridget Everett premiered. During Everett and Seinfeld’s conversation, she clearly brings up Bobcat Goldthwait even though his name was bleeped out. After all, you could read Everett’s lips and Jerry’s went on to quickly bring up the voice Goldthwait was famous for. Even though Everett calls Goldthwait her “good friend”, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seinfeld proceeds to rip into Bobcat in a two-minute expletive-laced rant</a>. Here are some of Seinfeld’s comments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I don’t like him. At all.” “I had kind of forgotten about him and then there was a little article about him in the paper and even in that there was a veiled reference to his dislike of what I did. It didn’t have my name, of course.” “He used to rail against me 'cause they weren’t as wild and dangerous as he was. 'Cause he sucked,” Seinfeld continued. “He wasn’t funny. And that’s why he didn’t get anywhere... 'Cause in comedy, nobody gives a f--- if you’re cool, if you’re lame. If you’re funny, you win. If you’re not funny, you don’t." “And he’s not funny. That’s why he had to do that stupid f---ing voice. 'Cause you have no f---ing act."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Seinfeld's Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee May Be Coming To An End</a></span></p><h2 id=bobcat-can-rsquo-t-stand-jerry-either>Bobcat Can’t Stand Jerry Either</h2><p>In Hollywood, there are several examples of one-sided celebrity feuds. When it comes to Jerry Seinfeld and Bobcat Goldthwait, however, the feelings of disdain clearly have been reciprocated. After all, in the past, Goldthwait has called Seinfeld out over and over again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobcat Goldthwait has had many colorful things to say about Jerry Seinfeld</a>. For example, at one point, Goldthwait claimed that Seinfeld’s “only talent is being Larry David’s friend”. On top of that, during a 1994 appearance on the Arsenio Hall Show, Goldthwait called Seinfeld “the devil” and described him as a “spooky, weird Scientologist guy banging teenage girls.” Later, Goldthwait would partially correct his Scientologist claim. On top of those comments, Goldthwait responded to Seinfeld’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee rant while talking to The Daily Beast in 2021. Ultimately, Goldthwait dismissed Seinfeld’s importance in his life. “I really don’t hate the guy. It’s worse. I don’t care about him. If you wake me up in the middle of the night, I don’t go, ‘Seinfeld!’”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s Why Jerry Seinfeld Is Difficult To Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7Kzvthmqp6hnpuyrbCMoZitnaNir7CuwpqrZp%2BfobG1tNaaoK1llprCpXnCqKSenKlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
