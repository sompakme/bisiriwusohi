We’ll see what happens.’ … I’m worried [to become a mom]. I’m nervous about just the whole change of my life, how every second’s going to be about this baby and something else instead of me and Colby. But I can’t wait to take it on.”</p><p>The then-expectant star subsequently announced her pregnancy via Instagram, gushing, “SPOILER ALERT. Here’s to my husband — thank you for the most incredible year of my life. Being married to you and starting our family has been the greatest gift. I am beyond blessed to have such a passionate, loving, strong partner to share this life with. We are so lucky to be loved by you. THREE MORE WEEKS UNTIL OUR BABY GIRL ARRIVES!”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>got engaged</a> during the reality dating show’s April finale,<a href=#> tying the knot only moments later</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Once I knew I was committed in [the] engagement, I knew I was ready for the next big thing, which was marriage and, like, wasting another beat when you got it right there on the biggest stage? Why not take advantage of the opportunity?” the groom told Us. “And I figure since she said yes to the engagement, why not say yes to the marriage.”</p><p>Ballatori clarified that she “never wanted a big wedding anyways,” explaining, “I knew that going into it, if I was going to say yes to the proposal, I’ve got to be ready to fully give it all. I think you saw I was kind of, like, ‘What the heck? Let’s do it.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatoJViwq3AyKaYra2dqHqurcOlsKdlkpa5ra3TqKmiZZOkuaPFjKSgrKuZo7SmvoywnKWbn6Kybn3SrWSbmZKufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
