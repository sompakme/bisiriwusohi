“Motherhood’s good stuff,” Caplan, 40, told GRAZIA USA in an article published on Monday, November 28. “Highly recommend. 10 out of 10 would recommend.”
The Mean Girls actress, who shares Alfie with husband Tom Riley, noted that she finds herself grinning from ear to ear when her little one hits another milestone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s been our experience.”</p><p>Caplan, who called her husband the “father of the century,” gushed over life with Riley and Alfie — and explained why she and the Dark Heart actor make a perfect parenting match.</p><p>“The division of labor can really fall to the woman in the majority of cases. I definitely could not have worked as much as I’ve worked this year if I didn’t have this partnership with my husband,” <a href=#>the Emmy nominee</a> confessed. “But also, it just wouldn’t be as fun if we weren’t sharing all of it 50-50. We’re pretty good at seeing the funny in stressful situations. I do feel very, very lucky.”</p><p>Caplan — who filmed Fleishman Is in Trouble and the upcoming Fatal Attraction series just months after welcoming her son — pointed out that raising Alfie doesn’t leave a lot of time for any additional passion projects.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have no hobbies; my hobby is him,” she told the outlet, joking that she has “no time for anything.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in September 2017 that the Castle Rock alum <a href=#>married Riley in Italy</a>. They welcomed Alfie four years later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloaqvxm6vwKmjmqZdnLa3sdJmqZqqlWLCsbDArZxmp55iurDAx56poaefmXqzrcisoKefXai8r3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
