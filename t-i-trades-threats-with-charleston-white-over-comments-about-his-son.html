He also referred to King as a “yellow-haired freak” in the clip, which has since garnered a response from the 18-year-old, who threatened to assault White on sight while alluding to him cooperating with law enforcement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Charleston White, you’s a bi**h, boy!” King said during his Instagram Live session. “We about to whoop yo ass when you come back down here from telling. I can see you had a soft upbringing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The younger Harris’ retort to White’s comments caught the attention of his father T.I., who blasted the Texas native for speaking ill of his son.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’ll spare no expense on your a** ’bout mine. Give a f**k about no police, I’ll do all my time, ni**a,” the “Pardon” rapper warned on an Instagram Live on Monday (Oct. 10). “I got family who are willing to risk their lives and freedom to die ’bout me and mine. Don’t fucking play with my muthafu**ing child ever, ni**a.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The King of the South continued his rant against White, echoing his son’s comments about White’s willingness to cooperate with the police at the threat of an altercation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Whatever man can fix his muthafu**ing face to talk sh*t about a muthafu**ing kid, bruh? You’s a hoe-a** ni**a. Come deal with the daddy. ‘Cause when the daddy get to getting on yo a**, you ain’t gonna do nothing but hit 9-1 and wait on the 1 to follow behind. Ni**a, if you don’t want no problem, what you keep on kicking up dust for?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Undeterred by T.I. and King’s remarks, White responded with his own Instagram Live, during which he attributed his comments to him being a “comedian” while continuing to voice his willingness to get the authorities involved due to the pair’s menacing comments.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m a senior citizen! That’s a threat, and he left me evidence,” White said. “I ain’t [fighting] no T.I. in a boxing match; I’m gonna put his son in jail. I’m a comedian, and I can make jokes about ugly babies. T.I. got an ugly baby.” He then took things a step further, threatening to shoot King in his throat in self-defense, referencing the tragic murder of Trayvon Martin in the process.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I just want to tell T.I. something. That ni**a said my momma raised a bi**h. Ni**a, your mommy and daddy raised a yellow freak,” he said. “That ni**a T.I.’s son said, ‘I’ll whoop yo old a**.’ Now T.I., you got a yellow muthafu**a look how yo son look talking about he’ll jump on a 50-something-year-old ni**a. Them the kinda boys you got?</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">White continued, adding, “Say T.I., listen. If yo boy jump on me, y’all a bury that yellow muthafu**a. I’ll shoot him in right in his godd**n throat. I wish a 18-, 19-year-old ni**a would jump on me. Boy, I’ll Trayvon Martin that little muthafu**a, I swear to God.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">White then aimed verbal barbs at T.I., recalling the rapper’s previous work with Crime Stoppers, which he promoted as part of his plea agreement stemming from his <a href=#>federal gun case</a>. He joked that T.I.’s efforts while fulfilling his community service obligations made such an impression on him that he has embraced working in tandem with law enforcement.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You better get your boy, Tip, and you better tell him you work for Crime Stoppers,” White said. “Remember? They had you going around doing the community service talking to the kids about reporting crime because you got caught with a bunch of guns on federal papers. We don’t know how you beat them charges, T.I., ’cause one thing every ni**a in the feds know, ni**as don’t give a damn about that sh*t. So tell your son you inspired me to be a tipster. Tell your son I got the badge idea from you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">T.I. voiced his desire to encounter White personally while acknowledging that his attempts to reach him had failed. “Still waiting to get on the phone or in ya face sir… been on hold since 1-2pm,” Tip wrote in the comments of a post on The Shade Room reporting the ongoing incident.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Afterward, in another Instagram Live later that night, White claimed that he had personally spoken to T.I., refused to back down from his previous statements.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Just got off the phone with T.I.’s b*tch-ass,” White revealed. “If I ain’t no comedian, ni**a, then I’m gonna handle it like I ain’t no comedian. You ain’t dictating nothing, not this conversation. I’m the big dawg talking. I ain’t trying to get down or give a ni**a one so f**k you in your pu**y, Tip. That’s exactly what I just told the ni**a on the phone.“</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While White said he wouldn’t attempt to have King imprisoned, he continued to denigrate his father, calling T.I. various expletives while deeming the rap star’s aggressive response to him as bluff.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yeah, I might be the police and guess what? They asked me, ‘You gonna put Tip’s son in jail?’ I said, ‘Nah, I ain’t gonna get him.’ When I stepped to his b**h-a** daddy he ain’t have all that tough sh*t in his voice. Ni**a, you ain’t no millionaire ready to crash out and go to no muthaf**king 23-hour lockdown. Stop talking tough trying to sell that sh*t to the people, ni**a. You a straight-up pu**y, ni**a.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">White also referenced the sexual assault allegations made against Tip and his wife, Tameka “Tiny” Harris, and called T.I. a “rapist” in the clip.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Charleston White address his issues with T.I. and his son King Harris below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m2bsDHq5yarKNisKmt0aWcrKyfo3q4tMitnGajmaO0brTAq6miq11mf3SAlmlnb2plZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
