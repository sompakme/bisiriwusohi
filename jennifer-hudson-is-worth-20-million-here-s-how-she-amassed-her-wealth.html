This certainly holds true for Jennifer Hudson, who managed to blow everyone out of the ballpark with the range of her insanely incredible voice. Even though she wowed the entire world (and the judges), she didn’t win the singing competition. She came in seventh, but her career was launched thanks to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, Hudson has a slew of awards under her belt (including an Academy Award for her showstopping performance in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreamgirls</a>), and she’s worth an estimated $20 million. She is so rich because she has made smart money moves in her career. Here are some ways she managed to amass her wealth while becoming a superstar in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=that-voice-of-gold><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>That Voice Of Gold</span></h2><p>Her voice captured the attention of everyone in that audition room on that fateful day in 2004 - in fact, she managed to hypnotize the entire world. Even though she didn’t go on to win the competition, the world knew her name and face, thanks to American Idol. The show jumpstarted her career in the music industry and Hollywood, as well.</p><h2 id=up-and-coming-before-american-idol><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Up And Coming Before American Idol</span></h2><p>Jennifer ended up finding her niche when she was only seven years of age. At the time, she joined her church choir and realized she had strong singing pipes. She knew how to belt out tunes with the awe-inspiring beauty of the greatest music diva. She continued to sing as she grew up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things That Go On Behind The Scenes Of American Idol</a></span></p><h2 id=her-foundation><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Her Foundation</span></h2><p>It’s incredibly inspiring how Jennifer seemed to dazzle the entire world with her angelic and powerful voice, especially when we learn that tragedy seemed to follow her as she became famous. Her mother, brother, and nephew were murdered in 2008.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Hudson set up a foundation</a> in her nephew’s honor. She is such a strong and amazing woman.</p><h2 id=keeping-busy><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Keeping Busy</span></h2><p>After her elimination from&nbsp;Idol, (which&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elton John referred to as "incredibly racist" on Today)</a>&nbsp;there was controversy. She was eliminated from the show even though she blew everyone else away. After that, it took Jennifer a couple of years to get signed with a record label. She got a deal with Arista Records. That lead to the release of her debut album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=friends-in-high-places><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Friends In High Places</span></h2><p>It also helps to have some friends in high places when you’re climbing that wealth ladder. And Jennifer has a slew of them. Jennifer had the chance to star with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce, who is rumored to be feuding with Kim Kardashian</a>) in Dreamgirls. She and Bey became quick friends - they often run into each other at famous events every now and then.</p><h2 id=american-idol-benefits><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>American Idol Benefits</span></h2><p>Even though it was a travesty that Jennifer was booted from the reality show so early in the competition, that didn’t put a damper on her career in general, though it might have felt pretty depressing to her at the time. Jennifer was extremely patient and it ended up paying off for her in the long run.</p><h2 id=her-move-to-the-big-screen><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her Move To The Big Screen</span></h2><p>Ask anyone who has ever watched the movie – when you think about how amazing the cast was in Dreamgirls (Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce), what really stands out is Jennifer’s scene where her character, Effy, belts out the song, “And I’m Telling You.” It’s what helped her land the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-the-big-stage><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>...And The Big Stage</span></h2><p>Sadly, the world lost legendary NBA superstar, Kobe Bryant, this year. A helicopter crash took his life and the life of his daughter, Gianna. At the NBA All-Star game on February 16, Jennifer delivered a powerful tribute to Kobe by singing “For All We Know” just before the game tipped off.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kobe Bryant Had A Hidden Talent...Here's Why He Developed It</a></span></p><h2 id=the-social-media-game><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Social Media Game</span></h2><p>Like a lot of other celebrities, Jennifer Hudson’s social media game is top-notch. You can commonly see her on Instagram modeling new clothes and hairstyles, and goofing off with her friends. She gives her fans backstage peeks at all that goes on before and after her concerts. It helps her pocket to be socially active on Instagram.</p><h2 id=numerous-appearances><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Numerous Appearances</span></h2><p>Whenever she has a new album out or goes on tour, Jennifer makes sure to put in her face time with the press. She does all the junkets. She does the late-night circuit (when she makes appearances on shows like The Tonight Show) and the morning talk show route. It may be the most tedious part of her work, but it needs to be done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=using-her-influence><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Using Her Influence</span></h2><p>Jennifer went from idolizing some of music’s biggest artists, like the late Whitney Houston (whom she honored by performing Houston’s iconic, “I Will Always Love You” at the Grammy Awards in 2012) to becoming a passionate influencer herself. Hudson inspires young, up-and-coming singers. Along with Houston, Jennifer also idolizes singers like Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Adam Levine And Other Judges From The Voice Have Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=style-icon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Style Icon</span></h2><p>Instagram has become a hot spot for sponsored posts by celebrities - it’s how they make those paychecks sometimes. But unlike, say, a particular reality show family who constantly posts about a this-or-that shake that will help you lose weight - Jennifer can be seen sporting new looks and thanking her stylists. Jennifer's approach brings in business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-time-on-the-voice><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Her Time On The Voice</span></h2><p>Jennifer joined the panel of judges on The Voice UK back in 2017 and immediately made an impact by guiding Mo Adeniran to win the crown in the show’s sixth season. Unfortunately, due to filming commitments in the U.S., Jennifer had to leave the show in 2019, which upset some of her fans! Her fans loved her on the panel.</p><h2 id=can-draw-a-crowd><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Can Draw A Crowd</span></h2><p>A lot of Jennifer’s wealth comes from the fact that she can draw a crowd whenever she performs. Before COVID-19 changed what we considered normal in this world, Jennifer announced her tour, which was scheduled for 2020 and 2021. Here’s hoping that she can still keep at least some of those dates when everything begins to open up again.</p><h2 id=her-albums-spun-from-gold><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Her Albums Spun From Gold</span></h2><p>Nothing helps amass Jennifer’s wealth like that voice of hers. She has 3 studio albums under her belt, 12 music videos, 20 singles, 8 album appearances, and 22 soundtrack appearances...along with a bunch of awards and honors. Her influence on the music industry is powerful - not only that, she is very influential in the reality show community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyonce's Makeup Artist Show You How To Get Zoom-Ready</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyhrJ2rn6N6r7HTZq6oqqSdenN8jKagpaSZpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
