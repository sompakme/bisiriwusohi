But in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, the actor revealed his serious side and why he's made the decision he has about which movie roles to accept, and which to turn down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The thing is, Jonah's got a great perspective on his career and the industry as a whole. But as he said of his personality behind each character he plays, "As an actor, some moments I’m joking around and really silly; some moments I’m serious."</p><p>He seems to want to remind fans that he's a real person behind his on-screen antics; that means he's not always a goofball. It took some time for viewers to see him differently, though.</p><p>At one point in his acting journey,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah was even the lowest-paid actor in a film</a>, and he didn't really mind.&nbsp;It took some time, but Jonah's decided to take a bit different path than he has previously in movies like 'Superbad.'</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a> quoted, Jonah wanted to move away from "bro comedies."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Baby 'Carlos' From 'The Hangover' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which is exactly why he passed on 'The Hangover.' The actor admits that he loves the movie, but as&nbsp;The Guardian relates, he was "frustrated with his comedy typecasting."</p><p>Jonah elaborated that, "I was getting lots of pressure to do movies like 'The Hangover' – and obviously I love 'The Hangover,' it’s hilarious – but it was a no-brainer for me." Because around that same time, Hill read another script that he knew was perfect for him, and it didn't involve self-deprecating jokes or slapstick comedy.</p><p>Jonah passed on 'The Hangover' because he'd "never read a script as beautiful as" the one for 'Cyprus.' When the opportunity presented itself, Jonah knew 'Cyprus' was the movie to help derail his comedy trajectory and allow him other chances at making serious films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What avoiding films like 'The Hangover' has really done for Jonah is helped boost him to where he wants to be: directing. As he told&nbsp;The Guardian, director Spike Jonze told him&nbsp;that "I’m carrying the baggage of 15 years of people thinking they understand who I am as an actor – and I have to make a great movie to get to zero... When he saw the film, he was like, ‘You’re at zero now'."</p><p>It sounds like Jonah is finally where he wants (and deserves) to be. But that doesn't mean he's turning his back on what gave him his big break. For example,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah's also pals with other comedians like Seth Rogen</a>, who was first pegged for a role in 'The Hangover' but also skipped the opportunity.</p><p>He's not cutting ties with either comedy or drama, but instead chooses to embrace roles that have the most potential for his career. So far, it seems to be working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonah Hill And Leonardo DiCaprio: Little Known Facts About Their Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdn7yvrcdmn6KknGK9or%2FSnptmp55itaK6xqitnqpdory3tcRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
