In the following, we're going to take a closer look at his experience on-set, and what he had to say about co-star Jessica Gunning during a recent interview on This Morning.

The dark story by Richard Gadd has been a major talking point over the last couple of weeks. Gadd has opened up about the experience during various interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of them came alongside This Morning. Gadd talked about the TV series getting picked up by Netflix, and his thoughts about working alongside Jessica Gunning. According to Gadd, he knew she was the perfect candidate from the start.</p><p>Gadd tells This Morning, "I adored her. There were times when we'd be shooting shots and the camera would be over my shoulder and on her, and I would forget to say my lines because I was like, 'Gosh, she's so good. Sorry, I messed up.'"</p><p>Gadd continued on with some high praise, calling Gunning the best actress in the UK.</p><p>"She's remarkable. I think she's the best actress in this country. I really do. I always had her in mind for Martha. I saw her on TV shows, I always saw a light, a darkness, I saw it all. I was pushing her from the start. She's great."</p><p>The moment can be seen below around the 4:00 minute mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-64.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kim Kardashian And Tom Brady’s Relationship Is More Confusing Than Ever After His Netflix Roast</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Netflix's The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady showed a tense moment between Kim Kardashian and Brady, but where do they stand today?</span><p>As expected, Gadd got strong praise from fans for his interview comments.</p><p>Fans wrote, "Richard is so incredibly brave for not only telling his story but physically acting this trauma out for the second time. I can’t even imagine how difficult that must be. We are all proud of you Richard."</p><p>Another fan wrote, "Never seen such realistic portrayal in media of what a victim has to go through and experience after being victimised. I haven't cried this much in a long time. We need more art that resonates with people."</p><p>Gadd is clearly receiving praise of his own, and that holds true from his co-star, Jessica Gunning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-gunning-was-a-fan-of-richard-gadd-before-baby-reindeer>Jessica Gunning Was A Fan Of Richard Gadd Before Baby Reindeer</h2><p>Even before she was cast in the role, Gunning knew all about Richard Gadd and the story of Baby Reindeer. Gunning wanted to see it on-stage, but the play was sold out, so she ended up settling for the play text instead.</p><p>“I just thought it was one of the most profound things I’ve ever seen really on stage,” she said. “Then I tried to go and see ‘Baby Reindeer’ the play, but it was sold out. So, I actually bought the play text, which is a bit Martha of me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar53691924.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:12</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_dwayne-johnson-and-ryan-reynolds-feud-may-prevent-red-notice-2-from-ever-happening_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Dwayne Johnson And Ryan Reynolds' Feud May Prevent Red Notice 2 From Ever Happening</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dwayne Johnson's behavior on the set of Red Notice made filming difficult for Ryan Reynolds, and it may be why there's no Red Notice 2 yet.</span><p>Gunning went on to reveal that the character of Martha was no easy task to master.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s not an easy, buttoned-up story,” Gunning said. “Everything doesn’t get tied up at the end. I think it’s messy, like life is. Their dynamic is complicated and he’s really honest about that. That’s so refreshing to see. The response to it is shown that audiences are really hungry for that. Hungry for honest, messy storytelling.”</p><p>Quite a process for Gunning and one she'll never forget.</p><h2 id=richard-gadd-admitted-shooting-the-series-was-an-emotional-process-behind-the-scenes>Richard Gadd Admitted Shooting The Series Was An Emotional Process Behind The Scenes</h2><p>Gadd had his moments behind the scenes, and one of them included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crying while filming an emotional episode in season 4</a>.</p><p>Gadd tells Variety, “We did close the set, but I was looking over and you’d see the props guys wiping tears from their eyes as they would be putting the props back how they should be,” Gadd said. “The show was based in such a trauma that everyone on set felt at times it was a huge, weighty thing. And it’s why I think everyone had such respect for everything. I was blessed with this amazing team who kind of felt it with me in a lot of ways.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/richard-gadd-in-baby-reindeer.jpg><p>Ultimately, for Gadd, the biggest importance was trying to tell the truth.</p><p>“I never wanted to kind of lie,” he said. “I always had to constantly check myself to be like, ‘Does this feel truthful to me to my experience all the way through?’ And if it didn’t, I would have to bring it back.”</p><p>The actor clearly followed through in his vision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2Blecaam51lmprAtLXCmmSgrZ6jtq%2BzjKucpZmknryvv8eip2aakZfGbr7EoqWdnZWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
