In the snap, Reginae cuddled up to her father alongside her half-brothers.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wayne proved that fatherhood never stops as he answered a phone call from Kameron while recording an episode of the <a href=# rel=noopener>“All the Smoke” podcast</a>.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, one second,” Wayne said as he answered the phone. “That’s Killa, that’s Kam, he’s going to sleep.”</p><p>Podcast listeners heard Wayne say, “Goodnight boy, l love you. Where boss man? He asleep?” He appeared to be referring to Kameron’s 6-year-old brother, Kross, whom London shares with the <a href=#>late Nipsey Hussle</a>.</p><p>“They got a picture of his daddy on the wall looking just like him,” Wayne explained of Hussle before sharing I “love you” messages with Kameron.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Wayne discussed how “important” it is for him to be a father.</p><p>“I didn’t have one of those, I didn’t have a father, so it’s not easy to do something you didn’t have done for you and try to figure it out,” he explained. “When you’re in a position like myself, you don’t ask. I figured it out, and I’m at the age now where it’s not a challenge anymore. It was a challenge before. Their love cancels all the challenges out.”</p><p>Wayne doesn’t share many family photos via Instagram, but Reginae seems to give the public a look at their family dynamic.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Forever the princess surrounded by a whole bunch of real ones ❤️,” she captioned a post from February, in which she’s hugging her father. That same month, <a href=# rel=noopener>Reginae honored Wayne</a> after he was awarded the Recording Academy Global Impact Award during a dinner presented by the Black Music Collective.</p><p>“The Goat 🐐 The Best Rapper Alive ‼️ But You Still Hold many other titles ! One being , A Great Father To Your kids ! I wouldn’t trade this life for anything or anyone ! Seeing you get your flowers last night was bittersweet!” she wrote at the time. “You paved the way for so many and still continue to break barriers and Make Your mark all around the world ! 20+ years in this game and if you play any song of his , you’re bound to still perform that mf like it was released last month ! That’s Goat Talk ‼️ I love you father ! So proud of you!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaloZxixKLFzZ5krKGkqHqku9Srq6yhlJp6uLXToWRsZaOku7R5wK1kpaejYq6vs8SlnKxlnJa4pr7SZp6apZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
