The controversy started after the Grammy winner, 27, took to Instagram to share a composite photo of her daughter, Kulture Kiari, that showed what the 2-year-old may look like as an adult. In the comments section of the since-deleted post, a fan pointed out that the image looked like a combination of Cardi’s husband, Offset, and Carolina, 24."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In March 2019, she issued an apology after an old Instagram Live clip resurfaced of her admitting that she <a href=#>used to “drug” and “rob” men</a> when she worked as a stripper. Her mea culpa also raised eyebrows, leading the hashtag #SurvivingCardiB (a play on the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly) to trend on Twitter.</p><p>“I never claim to be perfect or come from a perfect world wit [sic] a perfect past I always speak my truth I always own my s–t,” Cardi told her Instagram followers at the time. “Im apart [sic] of a hip hop culture where you can talk about where you come from talk about the wrong things you had to do to get where you are. There are rappers that glorify murder violence drugs an [sic] robbing. Crimes they feel they had to do to survive. I never glorified the things I brought up in that [Instagram] live I never even put those things in my music because I’m not proud of it and feel a responsibility not to glorify it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The entertainer went on to say that she “had very limited options” when she was coming up in the industry, which resulted in the “poor choices” she made in order “to survive.” She also vowed to “be a better me for myself my family and my future.”</p><p>Learn everything you need to know about CBD, Omega 3s, and Essential Oils.
