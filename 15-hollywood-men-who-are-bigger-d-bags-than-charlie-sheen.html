That's it. You got it right. A Hollywood D-bag! While there are certainly celebrities who haven’t let the spotlight go to their head, we can assure you that these 15 men don’t belong with them. The privilege and access that their careers have given them have turned them into the kind of guys you wouldn’t ever want to be caught dead in a conversation–or relationship–with, because they pull the jerkiest stunts ever!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This list includes some of the lower-level d-bags who insist on taking themselves seriously, engaging in juvenile antics, and blabbing all about their personal conquests. But we also have the heavy-hitters...literally. Some of the bigger d-bags on our list have made headlines for hitting or harassing women, and generally becoming violent a-holes who think they have a free pass to behave outrageously because of their famous name. Becoming a d-bag in Hollywood doesn’t happen overnight. It's usually the result of an already jerky guy who isn’t told “no” when he should be. With <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> out of commission and out of the spotlight lately, we’ve got 15 other guys who would happily fill his shoes as the biggest d-bag in Hollywood!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonah-hill><strong>Jonah Hill</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jonah Hill</a> doesn’t seem like your traditional d-bag. Owe it to the characters he plays, which are generally affable, overweight, underdog types who are good for a funny one-liner. Plus, he belongs to <a href=#>Judd Apatow</a>’s gang that counts <a href=#>Seth Rogen</a> and <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a> as members. So we assume he can’t be that bad of a guy, right? Well, it turns out that Hill is kind of an a*s himself! Since his Oscar-nominated turn in Moneyball, alongside <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, Hill has earned a reputation for being obnoxious, prideful, and condescending towards interviewers. To be fair, an interview with Rolling Stone asked him what kind of farter he was, and Hill was aghast at the question, since he was trying to become a “serious actor.”</p><p>One of the most memorable encounters with Hill and another celebrity was with none other than CNN’s <a href=#>Don Lemon</a>. Allegedly, Hill mistook Lemon for a bellman at a hotel in 2012 and the two engaged in a war of words on Twitter, ending with Lemon passing on some sage advice to the actor: “Be nice. Stardom is fleeting.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-franco><strong>James Franco</strong></h2><p>Maybe it’s a case of art imitating life, but <a href=#>James Franco</a> has lately been taking up some roles that try and present him as a total d-bag–but a d-bag with a heart of gold. In real life, however, Franco just seems like a gigantic d**k! To name a few of his biggest d-bag moves: he allegedly got an NYU professor fired when the professor gave him a D, even though Franco had only shown up to two of the 14 classes; he relentlessly pursued a girl on Instagram despite the fact that she was underage; he claimed that he was trying to “subvert” the Oscars during his dismal 2011 hosting gig; and he regularly considers himself to be a “deep artist” without actually creating any good work. His character in This Is The End was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the actor himself, but it seems like it was a realistic depiction of Franco although without the annoying elements that have made him such a creepy d-bag in the Hollywood scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-levine><strong>Adam Levine</strong></h2><p>He has the benefit of being a new dad to adorable baby daughter Dusty Rose, but no cute kid can eliminate the fact that <a href=#>Maroon 5</a> frontman <a href=#>Adam Levine</a> has been considered a d-bag among celebrities since he first burst onto the scene.</p><p>Since he has the looks, the money, the talent, and the love of a Victoria’s Secret Angel, Levine certainly has a lot to be proud of, but it’s the need for him to shove it into everyone’s face that turns a lot of people off the high-pitched singer. Plus, there’s the fact that he apparently slept with tennis star <a href=#>Maria Sharapova</a> (before his endless parade of models), and said that he was completely disappointed with their encounter because he had expected the athlete to do more than just lay there like a “dead frog.” One of the key markers of a major d-bag? A willingness to kiss and tell, unflattering descriptions and all! A quick search for “Adam Levine d-bag” will pull up more than a few moments when the singer let his gross personality shine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-bieber><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></h2><p>He’s been considered a bit of a little sh*t for a while, so is it really any surprise that <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> would end up on a list like this? Probably not! As his star rose, so did his level of arrogance. He soon began to tarnish his pristine image by engaging in criminal activity, like egging the house of his neighbor, speeding in residential neighborhoods, and even cutting shows short because his fans were screaming too loudly. Plus, there was that incident that saw him pee in a mop bucket on film, before insulting former President <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a>.</p><p>We know that Bieber has managed to clean up his act in recent years, but he’s still firmly established himself as a total jerk. Maybe it’s the peroxide hair, the multiple conflicting tattoos, the dirt ‘stache he insists on trying to grow, but whatever it is about Bieber, he’s an ill-mannered a-hole who enjoys playing with the feelings of his fans. We suppose it’s just a matter of time before both he and his devoted fan base finally grow up!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-mayer><strong>John Mayer</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Mayer</a> was considered a giant d-bag long before <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> skewered him in her song “Dear John,” and he has no one to blame but himself. While many celebrities engage in multiple conquests of famous, beautiful women, perhaps none have been so forthright about the dirty details as Mayer. <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=#>Jessica Simpson</a>, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>, and <a href=#>Minka Kelly</a> are just a few who have bedded the singer-songwriter, but it was his remarks about these women that cemented his d-bag status, which include: “My d*** is sort of like a white supremacist.” (2010); “My biggest dream is to write p*rnography.” (2010); “It was like s*xual napalm.” (2010)</p><p>That’s just a sampling of some of the outrageous things that have come out of Mayer’s mouth, as he’s tried to work his sensitive bad boy image. Fortunately, Mayer wisely decided to disappear for a while, moved to Montana, and quit drinking. So we’ll see if the new John Mayer is as much of a d-bag as the one we’re used to!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=russell-crowe><strong>Russell Crowe</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Russell Crowe</a> has earned a reputation for being notoriously difficult to work with, but it’s his violent outbursts that have put him firmly on the list of Hollywood d-bags. He’s reportedly lashed out at crew members to the point where directors had to calm down his diva behavior, swore at actress <a href=#>Rebel Wilson</a> when she simply told him hello, and started a fight with <a href=#>George Clooney</a> after calling him&nbsp;<a href=#>Harrison Ford</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Robert De Niro</a> sellouts for appearing in commercials.</p><p>While on the set of Gladiator, the role that earned him an Oscar and arguably made him a household name, Crowe was apparently unhappy with the script and attempted to rewrite the line. Once he said the line, he didn’t like it, and they went back to shooting the original. While everyone else loved it, Crowe still wasn’t pleased and was quoted as saying, “It was sh*t, but I’m the greatest actor in the world and I can make even sh*t sound good.” Sounds like someone needs a slice of humble pie!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wilmer-valderrama><strong>Wilmer Valderrama</strong></h2><p>Since dating <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> for six years (although the two have recently broken up) actor <a href=#>Wilmer Valderrama</a> managed to erase some of the d-bag antics he’d become famous for in the mid-2000's. Much like John Mayer, Valderrama was a womanizer who wasn’t afraid to kiss and tell–and even go low by spilling all the naughty details in interviews. While Valderrama played the skirt-chasing Fez on That '70s Show, he was able to snag women far more easily, including <a href=#>Mandy Moore</a>, <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a href=#>Ashlee Simpson</a>, <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a>, and a whole lot more. However, it seems like Valderrama was just as shocked about his conquests as we were, because he couldn’t shut up about it!</p><p>In a 2006 interview with <a href=#>Howard Stern</a>, Valderrama dished that he had taken Mandy Moore’s virginity (she responded that his remarks were “utterly tacky”), rated <a href=#>Jennifer Love Hewitt</a> an 8 out of 10, mentioned that Ashlee Simpson was a “screamer,” and confessed that Lindsay Lohan didn’t have implants but was a fan of waxing. If that’s not proof enough of this guy’s longstanding d-bag behavior, we don’t know what is!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alec-baldwin><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Alec Baldwin</a> has endeared himself to SNL viewers by playing D-bag-in-Chief <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> on an almost weekly basis as an honorary cast member. Maybe it’s because Baldwin doesn’t have to try hard to connect with his jerk roots. His temper has made him infamous in Hollywood, as he has attacked paparazzi and reportedly harassed an airplane crew by refusing to turn off his game of Words With Friends.</p><p>While we totally appreciate his candor in a lot of areas (it’s also especially enjoyable to watch him eviscerate the President regularly), it doesn’t excuse the fact that Baldwin has had a lot of d-bag moments. Back when daughter Ireland was only 11, Baldwin left a message that was later revealed to the press in which he called his daughter a “rude, thoughtless little pig.” Not exactly the kind of love you’re hoping to get from dear old dad! He’s been called a bigot, a sexist, and a narcissist, but we’ll settle with calling him a temperamental d-bag.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spencer-pratt><strong>Spencer Pratt</strong></h2><p>We’d hardly call reality TV star <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a> a celebrity, but we would call him a Hollywood guy who’s a bigger d-bag than Charlie Sheen! Since we were first introduced to the aptly-named Pratt on MTV’s The Hills, we knew he was to be the kind of grating villain we would all love to hate. In addition to manipulating his now-wife <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a> away from her friends and family, starting a rumor about an adult tape featuring <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a>, and essentially berating all of Montag’s loved ones, Pratt has continued to do whatever is necessary to ensure that he remains in the spotlight even though none of us care to see him anymore!</p><p>Considering the fact that the Urban Dictionary entry for the guy is “the definition of a d**che,” we can assume that everyone, including those who weren’t fans of the MTV show, was sick of see his peach-fuzzed face. Growing up as a spoiled rich kid in LA, Pratt has solidified himself as one of the biggest jerks of our time and he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alex-pettyfer><strong>Alex Pettyfer</strong></h2><p>Remember when Magic Mike came out in 2012 and everyone was drooling over one of the film's star, <a href=#>Alex Pettyfer</a>? It seems like a long time ago. That’s because Pettyfer essentially killed his career while working on the film and his d-bag reputation has made him disappear in Hollywood!</p><p>Pettyfer credits co-star <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> for poisoning his name in the industry, saying that Tatum disliked him largely because Pettyfer walked out on paying the rent for an apartment that was being leased to him by one of Tatum’s friends. While Pettyfer claimed that he was going through a tough time, reports surfaced that not only did he have blowout fights with Tatum, but he was regularly rude and angry on other film sets, showed up to work later, and caused his ex-girlfriend,&nbsp;<a href=#>Dianna Agron</a>, to hide away in a hotel after a threatening phone call. He’s dropped off the big screen for quite a while, and by the sound of his d-bag behavior, Pettyfer has no one to blame but himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mel-gibson><strong>Mel Gibson</strong></h2><p>Another actor who made the mistake of leaving an expletive-laden message, <a href=#>Mel Gibson</a> was exiled from Hollywood for a long time after going on anti-Semitic rants and getting arrested for a couple of DUIs. Only as of this past awards season has Gibson been welcomed back into Hollywood’s good graces. But, no one has truly forgotten the moment Gibson let his charming façade slip to reveal the d-bag underneath.</p><p>While his marriage to Oksana Grigorieva was falling apart, Gibson was reportedly extremely abusive to his wife and mother of his child. Furthermore, Grigorieva claimed that Gibson struck her on multiple occasions. While we have no clear proof of that, Gibson’s anger was evident in a series of phone calls that Grigorieva taped, the most notorious remark being when Gibson said heatedly, “You look like a f***ing b*tch in heat, and if you get r*ped by a pack of n*****s it’ll be your fault.” We’ll say that that is proof enough that Gibson has been a d-bag for a long time. He just hid it until he couldn’t anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=piers-morgan><strong>Piers Morgan</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Piers Morgan</a> is the kind of sexist, racist, misogynist pseudo-celebrity who simply enjoys riling people up just for the hell of it. No one is safe from the wrath of Morgan, from <a href=#>Chrissy Teigen</a> to <a href=#>J.K. Rowling</a>. But fortunately for all of us, they’re usually better at schooling Morgan on Twitter than he is at slinging his d-baggy barbs!</p><p>Using Twitter seems to be Morgan’s tool of choice when it comes to showing how much of a jerk he is, and he has spent much of it supporting Donald Trump and proclaiming that there is no Muslim ban, only a “travel ban,” claiming that black people were to blame for the use of the n-word, calling for a men’s march in response to the Women’s March on Washington, and even suggesting that <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>’s traumatic Paris robbery could be the best thing to ever happen to her! It seems like Chrissy Teigen had it right when she described Morgan in two words: “unequivocal d****e.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west><strong>Kanye West</strong></h2><p>When <a href=#>Kanye West</a> first started, he was lauded as an incredibly talented rapper and lyricist. Fast-forward to now, and the rapper-turned-designer is making headlines for his erratic behavior, poorly designed clothing, and personal life. Unlike the other d-bags on this list, West’s behavior and personality seem more related to mental illness and an incredibly inflated sense of ego than simply being an a-hole. He’s been outspoken (which was shocking at first) and now leaves the rest of us scratching our heads at his remarks. He also seems to have a thing for taking awards away from deserving artists and saying that <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> should have won instead. His desire to be a fashion designer is overshadowed by his over-the-top antics at his shows, which include forcing models to wait for hours in the sun with no water or shade and claiming to support Donald Trump, even though he admitted to not voting in the 2016 election. West may be considered an enigma, a mentally ill person, and a creative genius, but without a doubt, the guy is also a grade-A d-bag!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-brown><strong>Chris Brown</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Chris Brown</a> seemed obnoxious even long before we knew he was abusing <a href=#>Rihanna</a>. But the so-called bad boy’s reputation has grown to become that of a classless d-bag. In addition to the domestic violence he inflicted on Rihanna, Brown has solidified his spot as a d-bag woman-beater with model ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran, who claimed that the singer pushed her down the stairs, punched her in the stomach, told friends he was going to kill her, and threatened to shoot her. Oh, and this was all revealed after Brown pulled another d-bag move and cheated on Tran, impregnating Nia Guzman. As a result of Tran’s sworn statement, a restraining order was issued requiring Brown to stay 100 yards away from Tran, her mother, and her brother.</p><p>The big issue with Brown here, in addition to the obvious cowardly and d-bag move of beating up women, is the fact that he doesn’t seem remorseful of his actions. He was even charged with violating his five-year probation for beating Rihanna!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=donald-trump><strong>Donald Trump</strong></h2><p>It’s a sad thing when the leader of the free world is considered the biggest d-bag, but that’s what happens when that leader is reality show host-turned-President Donald Trump! There are a lot of d-bag moves Trump pulled even before he came to the White House. These include walking in on underage girls changing during the Miss America pageant simply because he could, publicly objectifying his eldest daughter in radio interviews and on TV, and the notorious Access Hollywood tape that saw him bragging about grabbing women without their consent, because he was a “star” and therefore entitled to.</p><p>Since coming to office, the d-bag antics of Trump show no sign of slowing down, from instituting a travel ban that primarily targeted visitors from Muslim-populated countries, refusing to release his tax returns, going on a “victory tour” instead of settling into the highest office in America, defunding multiple institutions including NASA, accusing former President <a href=#>Barack Obama</a> of wire-tapping, and using his Twitter account as a way to voice all of his crazy ideas. Without a doubt, Trump earns the title of biggest d-bag with a capital ‘D’!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2dvK242LCmqJxdorKvedahpmaZopp6o7XGoJyrZZRir6Kz0maroZmeYrCprdGloJ5lo52yprqO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
