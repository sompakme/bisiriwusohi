Jericho talked about the theme of the book and why it differs from his other books that he’s previously released, and then he addressed some interesting wrestling topics.</p><p><a href=#>Chris talked about something that has previously been out there</a>, his one night return to Smackdown Live following the Battleground PPV. He had said on his podcast that he was there that night to film segments for “Southpaw Regional Wrestling,” which he confirms to be true in this interview. What he does reveal, however, is that night he was scheduled just to face AJ Styles and that it was scrapped and made a triple threat match with Kevin Owens because they botched the finish at Battleground and they needed to get the belt back on AJ Styles.</p><p><a href=#>He also talks about Enzo Amore going to 205 Live</a> (which he had previously pitched to us on the show during an appearance back in May) and how he thinks it’s a great move for him, and that its where he had to go if he was going to continue to be an in-ring performer. He also says that he told Neville that he’s going to have to make him look good.</p><p>Also, <a href=#>Chris talks about how he forgot about his confrontation</a> with Floyd Mayweather on RAW and that he texted the picture to Vince telling him how he missed the boat on booking Jericho vs. Mayweather and how they could have made all this money. He also talks about how with Vince you need to know you audience: never pitch to Vince when he’s hungry and never pitch when he’s in the room with someone else. He had an idea for SummerSlam 2014 for Chris Jericho w/ Shawn Michaels in his corner vs. Bray Wyat w/ the Wyatt Family in his corner and it never happened because he pitched it in the wrong situation to Vince McMahon.</p><p><i>Busted Open with hosts Dave Lagreca, Bully Ray & Larry Dallas can be heard weekdays from 2p-4p Eastern Time only on SiriusXM Rush Channel 93 and is available any time on demand on the SiriusXM App.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwhJZya2xtXZi1s7XSZqGeqpmYtbB5zqdkraCVYq%2BwwMKhnJ1lo6nGrbHSZq2sZZ%2Bssq%2B%2FjJuYraycmrSzu9Snm2aemaO2tLSMnqWzp12ku25%2Bj25kpaGmmnqurdiwnJqsmJq%2FbrXDnphmoJVivarAwqGcnWWkpHq3tc2cnGalk6KuqbvN</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
