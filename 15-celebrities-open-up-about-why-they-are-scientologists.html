Initially, Hubbard developed a program of ideas which are called Dianetics which was distributed through the Dianetics foundation, which quickly entered bankruptcy. He then decided to re-characterize the subject as a religion, renaming it Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of spiritual nature. Scientology assesses the spirit - not the body or mind - and it believes that man is the product of his environment over everything else.</p><p>Throughout this time, Scientology has been something we hear about often, but something not many of us knows anything about. This religion has been spoken about by many celebrities, all of whom below follow these practices.</p><p>Regardless of whether&nbsp;you agree with the church or not, Scientology is part of our society and many smart, talented and intelligent celebrities believe it to be the way. This is why we at TheRichest thought it would be a good idea to find out which fifteen of our favorite celebrities are in fact Scientologist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The following fifteen celebs are all believers in the Church of Scientology, some you may be expecting to see on this list, like Tom Cruise and others may be a surprise, like Laura Prepon, however, you won't know who they all are unless you continue reading!</p><h2 id=15-laura-prepon><strong>15. Laura Prepon</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Laura Prepon</a>'s rise to fame began in 1998 when she landed one of the lead roles on the epic television series That 70's Show. The show aired until 2006 and from there, her career continued to grow. Currently, she is best known for her role as Alex on Orange is The New Black.</p><p>Prepon is one of those celebrities you would never expect to be involved in Scientology and when asked about her start in the religion she said the following</p><p>“When I first got into Scientology, I did Personal Values and Integrity and then Overcoming Ups and Downs in Life. These courses touched on the observations I was aware of when I was younger. It was right there in black and white. It was amazing, and I felt that finally, something was speaking my language. It totally connected with me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We are not too sure what that means, however, this is how the actress explained herself.</p><h2 id=14-danny-masterson><strong>14. Danny Masterson</strong></h2><p>Maybe there was something going on during the shooting of That '70s Show as&nbsp;our next celebrity, <a href=#>Danny Masterson</a> was one of the show's leading cast members and also became a Scientologist. Masterson is extremely talented and well spoken. His intelligence is demonstrated when he talks about his life, in all aspects of it.</p><p>Danny Masterson is very proud to have found Scientology,</p><p>“I have to say that one of the most important things Scientology has given me is the ability to keep my integrity together. I understand how people can get into unethical situations, and Scientology has always helped me keep my head clear and be in present time," he stated in a previous interview.</p><p>If you are a fan of Masterson's work and have not yet seen The Ranch on Netflix, check it out!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-bijou-phillips><strong>13. Bijou Phillips</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Bijou Phillips</a> is a model, socialite, singer and actress. The daughter of John Phillips, famous musician began her rise to fame as a model but quickly turned over to singing and acting. By the age of thirteen, she was already gracing the cover of Italian Vogue.</p><p>Phillips appeared in films such as Bully, Almost Famous, Venom, Octane, and Choke. She also appeared numerous times on the television series Raisin Hope.</p><p>In 2011, this beauty tied the knot with our previous celebrity, Danny Masterson. She and her husband are both very proud to be part of Scientology and he especially has gone on record many times defending it,</p><p>“You will not find a Scientologist who does not f--king hate psychiatrists because their solution for mental and spiritual problems is drugs. So let’s talk about putting a Band-Aid on something that’s just going to get worse and worse and worse.” said the actress in an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-anne-archer><strong>12. Anne Archer</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Anne Archer</a> is one of those people in show business that have been around forever. The American actress was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987 for the classic film Fatal Attraction. She has appeared countless times on screen for other films such as Paradise Alley, Short Cuts, Patriot Games and Lullaby.</p><p>Archer has been very open about her beliefs in Scientology</p><p>“Scientology has been very meaningful in my life. It's taught me a lot of good information. A lot of sanity. It's a lot about responsibility and it's very smart stuff that has helped me in my life” she said in a previous interview. Scientology is a big part of her life and she has tried to show her boys how incredible she finds it, as she went on to say</p><p>“My older son has embraced Scientology, but my younger son hasn't, which is absolutely fine. There is no conflict. It's only true if it's true for you.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-nancy-cartwright><strong>11. Nancy Cartwright</strong></h2><p>Some of you may not immediately recognize this Ohio native from the face, however, <a href=#>Nancy Cartwright</a>'s voice, is one that is sure to trigger memories. This American actress, voice actress, and comedian is recognizable for her long-running role as Bart Simpson on the legendary animated television series, The Simpsons. The Simpsons is without a doubt a classic television show that is a favorite of many.</p><p>Cartwright has had an incredible career in this industry and has proven herself as one of the best in the business, however, a lot of people may be surprised at the impact of Scientology on her life.</p><p>When asked about Scientology Cartwright said, "After I became a Scientologist my abilities expanded so far and above what I originally dreamed that I've amazed even myself."</p><p>We're sure she isn't the only one who is amazed at her abilities, even if you aren't also a Scientologist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-erika-christensen><strong>10. Erika Christensen</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Erika Christensen</a> is beyond talented when it comes to acting. Her impressive resume includes films such as Swimfan, Traffic, The Banger Sisters, Flightplan and How to Rob a Bank.</p><p>Christensen also appeared in the touching and successful television series Parenthood. This ambitious and hard working wife and mother have earned her right to call herself a celebrity. Not only has she proven herself as an actress but also as a woman who defends and sticks up for what she believes in.</p><p>Christensen has gone on the defense about Scientology many times, partly because her fans do not understand the religion. She claims it is not “Hollywood's religion” but it is a place that is open to everyone.</p><p>"If I had to sum it up, the goal of Scientology is giving the person back to themselves, like, your own power of choice,"&nbsp;said Christensen in a past interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-isaac-hayes><strong>9. Isaac Hayes</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Isaac Hayes </a>is a forced to be reckoned with in this industry. The singer-songwriter, producer, and actor has had an incredibly impressive career. Isaac Hayes is best known for his musical score for the film Shaft.</p><p>Hayes, who is born in Memphis Tennessee is one of those celebrities that people would never guess is a follower of Scientology. Hayes is also very well known for playing the voice of Chef on South Park and in 2005 when he left the show, rumors circulated that he left the show because it poked fun at Scientology.</p><p>However, his son later went on record stating the following,“My father was not that big of a hypocrite to be part of a show that would constantly poke fun at African-American people, Jewish people, gay people — and only quit when it comes to Scientology. He wouldn't be that hypocritical.”</p><h2 id=8-kelly-preston><strong>8. Kelly Preston</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kelly Preston</a> is a beautiful actress and former model. Preston is without a doubt one of the most naturally beautiful celebrities to ever live and when she married <a href=#>John Travolta</a> in 1991 they seemed like the perfect couple. However, their relationship has not always been easy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2009, the couple faced a horrible tragedy when their 16-year-old son Jett, died during a family vacation in the Bahamas. Preston relied on both her family and Scientology to help guide her through this time</p><p>“In Scientology, we have what’s called ‘auditing,’ and that helps you to address things in your life and to strip them away ... It's a path of spiritual enlightenment. Also, it helps rid the mind of painful experience completely. Through that, the people at my church literally held my hand and got me through ... I will forever be indebted” stated Preston in a past interview.</p><h2 id=7-elisabeth-moss><strong>7. Elisabeth Moss</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Elisabeth Moss</a> is a thirty-four-year-old California native who has made her name in the world of show business due to her intense acting skills. The actress has appeared in a ton of movies and television shows including Girl Interrupted, High-Rise, Queen of The Earth and of course, Mad Men.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Moss called it quits with her husband <a href=#>Fred Armisen</a>. The couple had a very public divorce and rumors circulated that her devotion to the Church of Scientology was one of the reasons for the split.</p><p>Moss believes that her faith both gives her stability and makes her feel like the best her possible.</p><p>“I think that’s a good way of saying it because there is so much focus on the, I guess, empowerment and, sort of, respecting yourself, and yourself as an individual, it is a better you, not necessarily changing who you are,” said Moss.</p><h2 id=6-beck><strong>6. Beck</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Beck</a> is a grammy winning, singer, and songwriter who has released hit after hit, album after album for over twenty years. He is an artist, a visionary and a man with a lot of intelligence. Beck claims his father was practicing Scientology before he was born and that the religion is simply something he has always been around. He compared Scientology to yoga and meditation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Everybody&nbsp;is trying to figure out a way to deal with their issues and things that are unresolved. I mean, some things just don't resolve. But whatever's going to get you through. That's my feeling about it." said the musician.</p><p>We at TheRichest, may not fully understand Scientology but we do understand where this music legend is coming from when he says this. In life, we all need something to help us get through and if Scientology works for him, then there is nothing wrong with that.</p><h2 id=5-jenna-elfman><strong>5. Jenna Elfman</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jenna Elfman</a> is the total package. She is beautiful, funny, talented and famous. She is one of those actresses that you can't help but love. Most of you probably remember her from the hit television comedy Dharma and Greg.&nbsp;Jenna Elfman married Bodhi Elfman in 1995 and he was already part of the church.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She began learning through him and became interested in participating herself. She described her involvement in a past interview, saying “He didn't push it on me or anything. I started becoming curious, from hearing him talk about it. I took a course where you get the basic concepts. It was everything I felt I already knew, but I was missing pieces, so I couldn't apply it to life.”</p><p>The Elfman family, including their two children, are all believers of this faith.</p><h2 id=4-juliette-lewis><strong>4. Juliette Lewis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Juliette Lewis</a> is awesome. The American actress earned her first taste of fame for her role in the 1991 remake of Cape Fear done by the talented Martin Scorsese. This role earned her a nomination for both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. From there the actress appeared in even more amazing roles in films such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Natural Born Killers, From Dusk till Dawn and Basketball Diaries. With a resume like this, it is no wonder Lewis has continued to find success as the years went on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not many people realize this but Juliette Lewis is a follower of Scientology and is very defensive when it comes to her religion. She believes that the media portrays the religion unfairly and she does not appreciate the way followers of this faith are viewed by many.</p><p>“It’s a religious philosophy and self-help movement. And you’ll never see a truthful word written about it in mainstream media," said Lewis in a past interview.</p><h2 id=3-kirstie-alley><strong>3. Kirstie Alley</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Kirstie Alley</a> made herself a household name when she appeared on the infamous film, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan” as well as the classic television show Cheers.</p><p>Alley is one of those celebrities who is extremely vocal about her beliefs and sometimes, actually, a lot of the time, she ends up rubbing people the wrong way. Alley has been very open and proud to be part of the Church of Scientology and has&nbsp;little respect for anyone who insults her beliefs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When you are generalizing, and when your goal is to malign and to say things about an entire group - there are tens of millions of Scientologists in the world - when you decide to blanket statement that 'Scientology is evil,' you are my enemy.” said the actress.</p><p>So, to any of you looking to be on Kirstie Alley's good side, be sure to not insult anything she believes in, especially Scientology.</p><h2 id=2-john-travolta><strong>2. John Travolta</strong></h2><p>We may have already covered his wife, but that just was not enough. <a href=#>John Travolta</a> is one of those celebrities that pretty much everyone around the world can recognize. He is what many like to call, a living legend. Travolta has had one hell of a career, from movies like Pulp Fiction, Saturday Night Fever, and Grease to films like Hairspray, Travolta has done it all.</p><p>Currently, Travolta is filming a movie in New York where he is set to play John Gotti, a powerful gangster who had quite an interesting life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travolta is talented, there is not denying that, however, that does not mean that his fans must agree with what he believes in, especially not Scientology, but we don't think that bothers him too much.</p><p>"I've been so happy with my Scientology experience in the last 40 years,” said the actor.</p><p>He also has claimed that Scientology helped him through his darkest time when his son Jett passed "I've been brought through storms that were insurmountable, and Scientology has been so beautiful for me, that I can't even imagine attacking it” said Travolta during an interview.</p><h2 id=1-tom-cruise><strong>1. Tom Cruise</strong></h2><p>I do not think anyone is surprised with who number one is on this list. <a href=#>Tom Cruise </a>is probably the most vocal member of the Church of Scientology. He has opened up on countless occasions in regards to what Scientology means to him. Cruise has reportedly allowed the church to almost dictate his life and many believe that he is in fact obsessed with Scientology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rumors have circulated that it is part of the reason why he and <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a> ended their marriage and that he asked the church to “cast” him a new girlfriend.</p><p>Many people, including us at TheRichest believe Cruise to be a little creepy. He has gone on to say,</p><p>“When you’re a Scientologist, and you drive by an accident, you know you have to do something about it because you know you’re the only one who can really help… We are the way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures,"</p><p>which we have really nothing to say about, but it is clearly a little weird.</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>independent.co.uk</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>businessinsider.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>mediaite.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZiyrbHBq6CtoZWoerC8xKdkrqhdlq%2BwwdNmrqGxXam1psWMmqmeZaOYtqa606ijqJ%2BZqMG0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
