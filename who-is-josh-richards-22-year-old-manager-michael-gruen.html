She stated that Gruen spoke disrespectfully of her to Richards with her in the room.</p><p>"He has said, the beginning of quarantine, that he wanted to send me on a one-way ticket to Mexico," Barret said, "And have me trapped there alone. I was seventeen, he is just rude...He's just a terrible person to be around."</p><p>That's a very different Gruen from the one depicted in&nbsp;Forbes writer and YouTube host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Ward's interview.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Is TikTok Star, Noah Beck Worth?</a></span></p><p>He spoke to young entrepreneurs through Brady and gave helpful pieces of advice such as, "Only ask for their time to chat. Don't go into the relationship trying to gain a job, an investor, etc. Ask for money, get advice. Ask for advice, get money."</p><p>Gruen sounded informed about social media and advice for those pursuing success in marketing. That, however, doesn't mean that he's mastered the art of respect behind-the-scenes.</p><p>He's collaborating with business legends like Gary Vaynerchuk and figuring out how to build the Sway House members' promotions as they lead different paths. That feat takes a special kind of talent.</p><h2 id=addressing-drama-but-sticking-to-business>Addressing Drama But Sticking To Business</h2><p>The<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> up-and-coming businessman</a> also addressed the drama with Barret, saying, "I don't hate Nessa. The whole thing isn't even true. That's the best part of it, there was a misunderstanding that occurred. I was calling someone else ugly, in context, and Nessa didn't understand what I was talking about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A woman's intuition is usually spot on, so while the conversation may have been a miscommunication, Gruen sounded more righteous than aware.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Was Perez Hilton Banned On TikTok?</a></span></p><p>He's still new to the industry and learning the fragile balance of personal and professional reputations. While he's the guy in the suit, encouraging his clients' careers, his own actions are important to keep in mind as well.</p><p>Sometimes the man who knows everyone isn't also the man who speaks highly of women.&nbsp;He has the drive and confidence to make it in a cutthroat niche, but one's character resonates longer than a new, shiny title for their resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tana Mongeau Claps Back At Bella Thorne Over TikTok Diss Track</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButs6sn2aqmZi1or7DrGRral2usqK%2BjKijnWWdlruis8SrZKahk52upriMoKmunZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
