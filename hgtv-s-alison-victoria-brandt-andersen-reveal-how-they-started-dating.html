But to me, I just love him,” Victoria, 42, exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>at the 6th Annual Critics Choice Real TV Awards on Saturday, June 15. “He is the most amazing human I’ve ever met. I love that everybody already knew how amazing he was. And now I could just be so proud to be next to him.”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Windy City Rehab </i>personality and film producer Andersen, 46, <a href=#>debuted their romance</a> via Instagram earlier this month and made headlines in the process. According to Victoria, the connection caught her off-guard.</p><p class=p1>“Surprises are good,” she quipped at Saturday’s awards fest, where she rocked a Paco Rabanne gown.</p><p class=p1>Andersen, who attended the event with Victoria, further told <i>Us </i>that <a href=#>they “were friends first”</a> before their bond turned romantic.</p><p class=p1>“I have no friends who I laugh with like I did with her,” Andersen, wearing a self-styled Louis Vuitton look, said on the red carpet. “It just became something more because we just love being with each other.”</p><p class=p1>Andersen also had “never” previously watched Victoria on <i>Windy City Rehab </i>before they got together.</p><p class=p1>“As soon as we met, I binge-watched [her show] like crazy,” he told <i>Us.</i> “Now, I’m like an expert on her show. She’s amazing.”</p><p class=p1>Anderson is also Victoria’s No. 1 fan off-camera.</p><p class=p1>“She’s just very honest. We have a very honest relationship where we just laugh and we laugh and we just have a great time all the time,” he gushed. “No matter what’s going on in our lives, we kind of laugh our way through. We dance.”</p><p class=p1>Victoria also said <a href=#>grooving with her man</a> is one of her favorite activities.</p><p class=p1>“We love cooking and dancing and laughing. It’s all about the simple things,” she stressed.</p><p class=p1>While Victoria and Andersen are basking in their blossoming romance, it likely won’t be captivated onscreen anytime soon.</p><p class=p1>“Oh, God. I mean, never say never,” Victoria joked. “We’ll see. You never know.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Victoria has starred on HGTV’s <i>Windy City Rehab </i>since 2019, flipping houses in her hometown of Chicago.
