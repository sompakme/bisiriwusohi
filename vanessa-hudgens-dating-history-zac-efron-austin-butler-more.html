After meeting in 2005 on the set of the Disney Channel Original Movie that made them household names, Hudgens and Efron quickly fell in love and <a href=#>dated until December 2010</a>.</p><p>“Right off the bat, we had a connection,” she recalled to Glamour six months before their breakup made headlines. “I think everybody could see it. When we had our audition, they paired us together. And he was adorable.”</p><p>Efron’s rising star was one of the factors that led to his and the Grease: Live star’s split. In a March 2015 interview with The New York Times, she admitted that she “was really mean” at times in their relationship because “girls were running after him, and I was <a href=#>giving them death stares</a>.”</p><p>One year after her separation from the Neighbors star, Hudgens moved on with Butler. Efron, for his part, <a href=#>romanced a slew of actresses</a> including <a href=#><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Michelle Rodriguez</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Halston Sage</strong></a>. (He is currently dating Australia native <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Valladares</strong></a>, whom he met in June 2020.)</p><p>Hudgens and Butler <a href=#>fell hard and fast</a> for each other, but they <a href=#>were not in a rush</a> to take the next step in their relationship.</p><p>“I want to get married, travel, then have kids — probably in my late 30s. Everyone’s clock is different,” she told Women’s Health in November 2018, gushing that the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor inspired her “more than anyone.”</p><p>However, after nearly nine years as a couple, Us Weekly broke the news in January 2020 that the “Say OK” singer and Butler had <a href=#>gone their separate ways</a>.</p><p>Later that year, Hudgens revealed what she wanted from her next partner, telling <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in November 2020, “At the end of the day, it’s just about having similar fundamentals and wanting the same things. … If someone comes into the picture and can give me all those things, then great. It doesn’t matter if they’re in the public eye or not — if anything I prefer them not to be, but we’ll see, we’ll see.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same month, Hudgens and Pittsburgh Pirates player <strong>Cole Tucker</strong> went public with their romance by holding hands in Los Angeles.</p><p>Scroll down to see a timeline of Hudgens’ dating history!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkw6K6xKyqmmWYqrGosc2sZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqqtp6Kuerutwmacn6qfo3qiwdKtoKdlkqrBrbHRZqSoqpVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
