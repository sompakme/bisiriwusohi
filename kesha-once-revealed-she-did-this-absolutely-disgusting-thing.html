Always made to look shiny and happy when they appeared in public, when fans got to know those stars they were taught to think of them as being extremely well put together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike most of her peers, when Kesha rose to prominence her image included a certain amount of grime and gaudiness. Always presented as the ultimate party girl early on, based on every aspect of Kesha’s initial image, it was easy to imagine her smelling like liquor and cigarettes. After all, Kesha’s song “Tik Tok” included a lyric referring to brushing her teeth with Jack. Since then, her image has matured a great deal and <a href=#>Kesha even dropped the dollar sign from her name</a>. However, a lot of people still associate the artist with the way she was perceived early on.</p><p>For fans of Kesha who still strongly associate the talented performer with her original image, it likely won’t come as a surprise that she once admitted to doing something gross. However, Kesha’s admission is so disgusting that even those fans are likely to be shocked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Kesha Song Are You, Based On Your Zodiac?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-truly-talented-performer>A Truly Talented Performer</h2><p>When Kesha’s debut hit “Tik Tok” became a sensation seemingly overnight, some observers wrote her off as a singing talent. The reason for that is that Kesha’s voice was heavily autotuned in that song which led some people to conclude that she could only sound good with a music producer’s help. In the years since then, Kesha has proven that she has an extremely powerful voice and everyone who underestimated her was in the wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Kesha’s vocal chops, there is one aspect of being a pop star that she is better at than most of her peers, garnering the world’s attention. No matter how much people like some pop stars’ music, they have little interest in listening to that performer taking part in an interview. When it comes to Kesha, however, she seems more than happy to say and do outrageous things which makes her interviews captivating. For example, after Kesha did something disgusting, she was happy to talk about it during a later interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Why Kesha Was Banned From Malaysia</a></span></p><h2 id=kesha-rsquo-s-revolting-admission>Kesha’s Revolting Admission</h2><p>In order to follow most of the favorite pop stars, viewers can only depend on music videos, concert clips, and interviews. A few years into Kesha’s reign of pop music supremacy, however, she agreed to star in an MTV “reality” show called Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life. In 2013, two seasons of Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life made up on 14 episodes aired. Of course, Kesha isn’t the first <a href=#>celebrity to star in their own “reality” show</a>. However, Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life featured a moment in which the pop star did something on camera that most stars would never even consider.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During one thoroughly hard-to-watch scene from Kesha: My Crazy Beautiful Life, her brother filmed the pop star drinking her own urine. While talking to BBC Radio 1, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kesha explained why she drank her own urine</a> and she described how she reacted when someone tried to stop her. "I was told drinking my own pee was good, I was trying to be healthy. Somebody tried to take my pee away from me, and I said, 'That is mine!' So I snatched it up and took a chug and it was really gross, so I don't do it anymore."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Got Their Start On Reality TV</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shocking-fans>Shocking Fans</h2><p>Based on everything we know about her IQ and SAT scores, the pop star <a href=#>Kesha is an extremely intelligent person</a>. Based on that information, it seems entirely possible that the singer saw drinking her own urine on camera as a calculated attempt to garner attention. After all, before her “reality” show aired, Kesha wound up in the headlines after people thought she drank something gross on another occasion.</p><p>A couple of years before footage of Kesha drinking her own urine aired on MTV, the popular singer performed at the Future Music Festival in 2011. Partway through her set, Kesha performed her vampire-themed tune “The Harold Song”. As Kesha sang that song, she shocked everyone in attendance when she drank a substance that was supposed to be blood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While talking about her bloody performance during an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kesha explained why she supoposedly drank blood</a>. "I think I was hanging out with Alice Cooper too much. I was just really inspired to do it. There wasn't a very good reason behind it." No matter what Kesha’s inspiration for that moment was, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the press quickly concluded that the substance wasn’t real blood</a>. Either way, Kesha drinking “blood” quickly became the subject of headlines all over the world. That kind of attention is the kind of thing that most pop stars desire.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Kesha's Upcoming Summer Tour</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinquYlnqwusKeZKudppqurbHDZqqhnV2ZtqV506GgrGWRl8CwuNStnKWxXZm2tLPUrKuippdiwam1zaBm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
