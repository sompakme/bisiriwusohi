There's something about their dynamics that have fans admiring their chemistry and truly hoping that this celebrity couple makes it to the next level.</p><h2 id=their-longtime-friendship-morphed-into-love><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their Longtime Friendship Morphed Into Love</span></h2><p>Harper's Bazaar has noted that one of the most interesting aspects of this relationship is the fact that it stemmed from a deep-rooted friendship. Rihanna and A$AP Rocky have been friends for well over a decade, and it's their solid foundation as trusted friends that has given them&nbsp;the ability to build an intimate connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They have always gotten along well with one another and have naturally spent time together on a friendship level, but at some point, Rihanna realized that friend zoning A$AP Rocky wasn't necessary, allowing their romance to develop naturally and flourish over time.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna Fans Turn Against Her And Drag Her On Social Media</a></span></p><h2 id=their-road-trip-sealed-the-deal-for-a-ap-rocky><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Their Road Trip Sealed The Deal For A$AP Rocky</span></h2><p>Every relationship has a defining moment, and for A$AP Rocky, that came&nbsp;in 2020 when he and Rihanna took a road trip together. He revealed that they rented a tour bus and embarked on what he described as being "a Great American Road Trip," which went a long way in solidifying the bond they shared with one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed that this was a unique opportunity for them to both just be themselves and not worry about the demands of work and the obligations of their careers, which truly gave them a chance to connect on a more intimate level.</p><h2 id=rihanna-changed-a-ap-rocky-s-entire-perspective><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Rihanna Changed A$AP Rocky's Entire Perspective</span></h2><p>A$AP Rocky has openly referred to Rihanna by saying; "my lady" and "the love of my life," which is a far cry from the womanizing ways he was previously known for. His reputation had him pegged as being a ladies man, so hearing him change his tune when talking about Rihanna was a real indication of how much he cared for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was something about Rihanna that changed his perspective on love, women, and relationships, and he acknowledges that this went full circle when he and Rihanna began dating. US Weekly quotes him as saying; "It's so much better when you got the One. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. </a>I think when you know, you know. She's the One."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React To A$AP Rocky & Rihanna's PDA During NYC Date</a></span></p><h2 id=a-ap-rocky-has-been-embraced-by-rihanna-s-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A$AP Rocky Has Been Embraced By Rihanna's Family</span></h2><p>One of the biggest telltale signs that a relationship is getting serious is when the family gets involved. One of the most interesting aspects of Rihanna's relationship with A$AP Rocky lies in how quickly her family embraced him and welcomed him in as one of their own. He joined Rihanna's family in Barbados during Christmas 2020, and he was fully immersed in all of the family gatherings, meals, and celebrations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>People reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they seemed very comfortable having him join the family</a>, and that everyone got along very well.</p><h2 id=a-ap-rocky-used-to-be-rihanna-s-opening-act><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>A$AP Rocky Used To Be Rihanna's Opening Act</span></h2><p>A$AP Rocky may be by Rihanna's side as her romantic partner these days, but truth be told, he was once her opening act! This interesting dynamic demonstrates how dramatically their relationship has changed and developed over time.</p><p>In 2013, Rocky joined Rihanna's Diamonds World Tour and performed as the opening act that warmed her crowd while she prepared to take the stage. He's likely to be backstage in the family and friends section for her next live show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-made-music-together><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They've Made Music Together</span></h2><p>This adorable duo isn't just compatible in the dating game, they happen to make beautiful music together, too. In 2012, Rihanna and Rocky collaborated on a remix of Rihanna's single Cockiness (Love It), which perhaps not-so-coincidentally, included a series of suggestive lyrics. The lyrics were provocative and tantalizing, and the pair truly seemed to be able to work alongside one another in the studio with ease and professionalism.</p><p>They executed the song perfectly and now look back at that time with fondness and happy memories. Their shared love for music and ability to create magical sounds together plays a huge role in their bonding process.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans React To Rihanna & A$AP Rocky’s PDA While Filming Their New Music Video</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-represented-one-another-s-brands><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They've Represented One Another's Brands</span></h2><p>Both Rihanna and A$AP Rocky are very busy behind the scenes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partaking in business ventures </a>that are far removed from the&nbsp;music industry. They both have side hustles on the go, and they have adorably represented and promoted one another's brands, helping to generate more sales for one another.</p><p>Rihanna stunned when she wore the Amina Muaddi crystal-embellished gladiator sandals that A$AP Rocky&nbsp;made in collaboration with&nbsp;his creative agency, AWGE, and he was delighted to return the favor. Rocky starred in an ad campaign for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna's Fenty Skin</a> Line, along with Lil Nas X, and captioned the message; &nbsp;"That's right baby...fentyskin is for my fellas too!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-ap-rocky-has-been-smitten-with-rihanna-for-years><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A$AP Rocky Has Been Smitten With Rihanna For Years</span></h2><p>Fans are in love with their love. The mere fact that A$AP Rocky has been smitten with Rihanna for so many years, and is now dating her, goes to prove that anything is possible. He has always expressed his love and adoration for the singer but was not able to act on it until now. Now that they're officially an item, fans are getting to see a different version of A$AP Rocky than they have seen before - the truly in love version.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna Once Came Close To Being Cancelled, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiecCsmKlloqSwrMWMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZpyVqa6quNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
