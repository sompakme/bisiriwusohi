Others were quick to call out that the <a href=#>Degrassi</a> alum might not have actually been romantically involved with the “Supermodel” songstress.</p><p>“Now why’d drake have to bring sza’s good name out like that,” one social media user tweeted on Friday, adding “HES LYING YOUR HONOR” in a separate post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Drake-Claims-He-Dated-SZA-on-21-Savage-Song-Mr.-Right-Now.jpg><p>Another joked, “Drake used to date SZA back in 08? Drake’s hitlist got more 10’s than his own discography FFS.”</p><p>Earlier this year, Drake made headlines for <a href=#>calling <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> his “side piece”</a> in a leaked song after previously <a href=#>sparking romance rumors</a> with the reality star, 23, in October 2019. “Yeah, I’m a hater to society / Real s–t, Kylie Jenner that’s a side piece,” he raps in the song, which was shared via an Instagram Live in May. “Yeah, I got 20 motherf–kin’ Kylies.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Grammy winner later revealed that the song, a collaboration with <a href=#><strong>Future</strong></a>, was recorded three years prior. “A song that mark ran last night on night owl sound live set shouldn’t have been played. It’s a song that leaked 3 years ago and got scrapped shortly after. He was just going too deep in the drake/future catalogue,” he wrote on Instagram at the time. “Last thing I’d want to do is wake up having any friends of mine feeling disrespected so I just had to say that to start off the day.”</p><p>Shortly after the lyrics <a href=#>took fans by surprise</a>, an insider told Us Weekly exclusively that “Kylie was not upset about Drake referring to her as a ‘side piece’ in his new song and she really doesn’t care.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJurmZuaeqS4wKKkrGWYmnqlrdOem2arqpZ6sLqMa2hmq5GrrqixjKymp59dor9uvsign61lnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
