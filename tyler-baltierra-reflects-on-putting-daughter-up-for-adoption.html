“10 years ago yesterday, we were only 17. 10 years ago, we brought you into the world. 10 years ago, we only got to hold you by ourselves for a half hour in the hospital as we just cried & stared at you, remembering every little detail of how absolutely perfect you were, since we knew that even though we just met, we had to say goodbye,” the Tierra Reign founder, 27, wrote alongside a photo of Carly holding his and Lowell’s 4-year-old daughter, Novalee."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Happy Birthday Carly! #Adoption #BirthparentStrong.”</p><p>The high school sweethearts welcomed Carly in 2009 when they were teenagers. The two made their debut on MTV’s 16 & Pregnant that same year, and have remained key players on Teen Mom since then. Despite a few rough patches in their marriage, their relationship has prospered and they now share the aforementioned Novalee, as well <a href=#>as 2-month-old daughter Vaeda</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Teen Mom costars and fans took to the comments section of Baltierra’s post to share their sweet messages of support. “I have the chills!!!” <a href=#><strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong></a> wrote. “So so proud of y’all & happy birthday to Carly!”</p><p>One commenter shared: “I’m quite a bit older than you all and you guys taught me something about true love 10 years ago. You showed all of us that sometimes love isn’t easy. You guys made the most selfless decision so that your precious baby girl could have the things you guys weren’t able to provide at that moment. You all were stronger than most of us ever could be! ❤️ Happy birthday Carly!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatsZyav26uwKWrop2ip65uvsSfo56bpKh6sLqMqaytrJmjtG6wwK6eoayVp3q2vIyfpqtlkZm8scDIqKVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
