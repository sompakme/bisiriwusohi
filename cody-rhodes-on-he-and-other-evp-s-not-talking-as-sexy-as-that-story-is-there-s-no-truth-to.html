AEW EVP and former TNT Champion Cody Rhodes spoke to the media ahead of this weekend’s Double Or Nothing pay-per-view event. Asked by Fightful’s Sean Ross Sapp about the rumors of he and the company’s fellow EVP’s, most notably AEW World Champion Kenny Omega and AEW Tag-Team Champions, The Young Bucks, not being on speaking terms, Cody said it’s a “sexy” story but it’s not true."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Asked by Fightful’s Sean Ross Sapp about&nbsp;the rumors of he and the company’s fellow EVP’s, most notably AEW World Champion Kenny Omega and AEW Tag-Team Champions, The Young Bucks, not being on speaking terms, Cody said it’s a “sexy” story but it’s not true.</p><p>“Well when I heard that, that story was floating around, it was one of those things that I chalked up as us being very successful with AEW. With NXT losing the Wednesday night wars, it caused a lot of anger and I understand that there’s a lot of hardcore NXT and WWE fans out there and that’s why stories like that don’t surprise me. I think people need to cling to something and as sexy as that story is, I talk to Matt and Nick everyday, I talk to Kenny very often, I support their projects fully, they’ve supported my projects and we would not be able to put this show on the air, Tony’s the man and Tony’s the boss but we would not be able to put this show on the air if the four of us were not talking. So, we unfortunately, it’s not very sexy to say, but there’s no truth to that. Again, we’re one team and now with us expanding onto TBS, we’ll remain one team.”</p><p>Cody Rhodes would also discuss the importance of fans coming back at full capacity, the company’s new weekly ‘Rampage’ show as well as other topics.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFsbXJrYGKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG67zWafnmWRo7FuwMeeZLKnpaO0bq7UnKKsZZ6kwW7AwKWioqaX</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
