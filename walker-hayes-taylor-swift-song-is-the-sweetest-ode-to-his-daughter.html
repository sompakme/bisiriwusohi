“Two Taylor Swift concert ticket stubs / Cost me more than my mortgage goes / And that was before T-shirts, cokes and popcorn /But, hey, I mean how many times does your little girl turn 9?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

True story time,” he captioned video footage of the pair performing the then-unreleased single in their kitchen.</p><p class=p6>To promote the release of “Taylor Swift” on Friday, September 29, Walker uploaded <a href=#>a clip of Swift cheering</a> for rumored boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a>’s Kansas City Chiefs to his Instagram Story. He added a “Listen to ‘Taylor Swift’” button to the post, which linked to the song’s Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music pages.</p><p class=p6>Walker and Laney were <a href=#>high school sweethearts</a> — who met during a school production of <i>Little Shop of Horrors </i>— before they tied the knot in 2004. Since then, the “Fancy Like” singer and Laney have gone on to <a href=#>welcome six children</a>: Lela, Chapel, Baylor, Beckett, Loxley and Everly. (The duo’s seventh child, daughter Oakleigh, <a href=#>was stillborn in June 2018</a>.)</p><p class=p6>“It’s important that your father loves you and that you know it,” Walker told <a href=# rel=noopener>Fatherly</a> in 2020 after his approach to parenting. “I know it’s important from being a son. I know my dad loves me. It has helped me to grow into a man. I always want them to know I’m in their corner.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p6>He continued at the time: “We don’t wake up as their parents and know every single thing we’re doing. I tell my 13-year-old all the time that we’re learning as we go along. It’s important to teach them to forgive themselves and each other.”</p><p class=p6>Walker Hayes’ <i>New Money </i>EP is out now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6apJuav260wLKcrGWklsatu9FmqrChlql6tLvNoGSiq12ptaZ50rCcnqyVqMFuu8OeZK2nXZ22tHnDmqygoKSav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
